<h2>Raising Arizona



 Script</h2>

<pre>

 

                   

My name is H I McDunnough.



 

                   

Call me Hi.



 

                   

The first time I met Ed was in

the county Iockup in Tempe, Arizona.



 

                   

- Don't forget his profile, Ed!

- Turn to the right!



 

                   

A day I'll never forget.



 

                   

Turn to the right!



 

                   

What kind of name is that

for a pretty thing like you?



 

                   

Short for Edwina. Turn to the right!



 

                   

You're a flower, you are.

Just a little desert flower.



  

                   

Let me know how those come out.



  

                   

Now, prison Iife is very structured...

more than most peopIe care for.



  

                   

But a spirit of comradery

exists between the men



  

                   

Iike you find onIy in combat, maybe,



  

                   

or on a pro ball cIub

in the heat of the pennant drive.



  

                   

In an effort to better ourseIves,

we had to meet with a counseIor,



  

                   

who tried to heIp us figure out

why we were the way we were.



  

                   

And all Pancho wanted

was a hot roll and butter.



  

                   

So... why do you use the word ''trapped''?



  

                   

- Huh?

- Why do you say you feel ''trapped''



  

                   

in a man's body?



  

                   

Well, sometimes l get

the menstrual cramps real hard.



  

                   

- Have you learned anything, Hi?

- Yes, sir. You bet.



  

                   

- You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Hi?

- No, ma'am, hope to say.



  

                   

OK, then.



  

                   

I tried to stand up and fly straight,



  

                   

but it wasn't easy with that

son of a bitch Reagan in the White House.



  

                   

I don't know. They say he's a decent man.



  

                   

So... maybe his advisers are confused.



  

                   

Turn to the right.



  

                   

What's the matter, Ed?



  

                   

- My fiance left me.

- She said her fiance had run off



  

                   

with a student cosmetoIogist

who knew how to pIy her feminine wiIes.



  

                   

- The son of a bitch.

- Don't forget his phone call, Ed!



  

                   

Tell him l think he's a damfool, Ed.



  

                   

You tell him l said so, H l McDunnough.



  

                   

And if he wants to discuss it,

he knows where to find me.



  

                   

The Maricopa County maximum security

correctional facility for men,



  

                   

State Farm Road, No.  

Tempe, Arizona. l'll be waitin'!



  

                   

l'll be waitin'.



  

                   

I can't say I was happy to be back inside,



  

                   

but the flood of famiIiar sights, sounds and

faces aImost made it feeI Iike a homecomin'.



  

                   

Most men your age are getting married

and raising up a family.



  

                   

- Well, factually...

- They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.



  

                   

Would any of you men care to comment?



  

                   

Well, sometimes your career's

gotta come before family.



  

                   

Work's what's kept us happy.



  

                   

I tried to sort through

what Doc Schwartz had said,



  

                   

but prison ain't the easiest pIace to think.



  

                   

And when there was no meat, we ate fowl.



  

                   

And when there was no fowl, we ate crawdad.



  

                   

And when there was no crawdad

to be found, we ate san'.



  

                   

- You ate what?

- We ate san'.



  

                   

- You ate sand?

- That's right.



  

                   

Well, Hi, you done served your    months.



  

                   

And seein' as how you never use live ammo,

we got no choice but to return you to society.



  

                   

- These doors are gonna swing wide.

- l didn't wanna hurt anyone, sir.



  

                   

- Hi, we respect that.

- But you're just hurting yourself



  

                   

- with this rambunctious behavior.

- l know that, sir.



  

                   

OK, then.



  

                   

I don't know how you come down

on the incarceration question,



  

                   

whether it's for rehabiIitation or revenge,



  

                   

but I was beginning to think revenge

is the onIy argument makes any sense.



  

                   

Show the tattoo!



  

                   

- Turn to the right!

- Don't forget his fingers, Ed.



  

                   

Hear about the paddy wagon

collided with the cement mixer, Ed?



  

                   

Twelve hardened criminals escaped.



  

                   

l heard that one.



  

                   

- Got a new beau?

- No, Hi, l sure don't.



  

                   

Don't worry, l paid for it.



  

                   

They say that absence

makes the heart grow fonder.



  

                   

And, for once, they may be right.



  

                   

You missed a spot.



  

                   

More and more my thoughts turned to Ed



  

                   

and I finally feIt the pain of imprisonment.



  

                   

Mama would throw the live crawdad

in a pan of boilin' water.



  

                   

Well, one day l decided

to make my own crawdad.



  

                   

And l threw it in a pot,

without the water, you see?



  

                   

And it was just like makin' popcorn, you see?



  

                   

Yeah, the joint's a IoneIy pIace

after Iockup and Iights out,



  

                   

when the Iast of the cons

has been swept away by the sandman.



  

                   

But I couIdn't heIp thinkin'

that a brighter future Iay ahead.



  

                   

A future that was onIy

eight to fourteen months away.



  

                   

They got a name for people like you, Hi.



  

                   

- That name is called ''recidivism.''

- Repeat offender!



  

                   

- Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?

- No, sir. That's one bonehead name.



  

                   

- But that ain't me anymore.

- Are you just tellin' us what we wanna hear?



  

                   

- No, sir, no way.

- Cos we just wanna hear the truth.



  

                   

Well, then l guess l am

tellin' you what you wanna hear.



  

                   

- Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that?

- Yes, sir.



  

                   

OK, then.



  

                   

Turn to the right!



  

                   

l'm walkin' in here on my knees,

Ed, a free man, proposin'.



  

                   

Howdy, Curt.



  

                   

- And so it was.

- Don't forget the bouquet, Ed!



  

                   

- l do.

- You bet l do.



  

                   

OK, then.



  

                   

Ed's pa staked us to a starter home

in suburban Tempe



  

                   

and I got a job drillin'hoIes in sheet metaI.



  

                   

So we were doin' paramedical work

with the state highway system.



   

                   

Not actually practicin', you understand.

Me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile...



   

                   

- Bill Roberts?

- No, not that mother-scratcher. Bill Parker.



   

                   

Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck



   

                   

and there's this spherical object

restin' in the highway.



   

                   

And it's not a piece o' the car.



   

                   

Most ways, the job was a Iot Iike prison,



   

                   

except Ed was waitin'at the end of every day

and a paycheck at the end of every week.



   

                   

Government do take a bite, don't she?



   

                   

These were the happy days,

the saIad days, as they say,



   

                   

and Ed feIt that havin'a critter

was the next IogicaI step.



   

                   

It was all she thought about.



   

                   

Her point was that there was too much

Iove and beauty for just the two of us.



   

                   

Every day we kept a chiId out of the worId

was a day he might Iater regret havin'missed.



   

                   

That was beautiful.



   

                   

So we worked at it on the days

we caIcuIated most IikeIy to be fruitfuI.



   

                   

And we worked at it

most other days, just to be sure.



   

                   

Ed rejoiced that my IawIess years were behind

me and that our chiId-rearing years Iay ahead.



   

                   

And then the roof caved in.



   

                   

Hi... l'm barren!



   

                   

At first I didn't beIieve it.



   

                   

That this woman, who Iooked as fertiIe as

the Tennessee valley, couId not bear chiIdren.



   

                   

But the doctor expIained that

her insides were a rocky pIace



   

                   

where my seed couId find no purchase.



   

                   

Ed was inconsoIabIe.



   

                   

We tried an adoption agency.



   

                   

lt's true that Hi has had a checkered past.



   

                   

But Ed here is an officer of the law twice

decorated, so we figure it kinda evens out.



   

                   

But bioIogy and the prejudices of others

conspired to keep us chiIdIess.



   

                   

Our Iove for each other

was stronger than ever.



   

                   

But I preminisced...

no return of the saIad days.



   

                   

The pizazz had gone out of our Iives.



   

                   

Ed Iost all interest in both

criminaI justice and housekeepin'.



   

                   

Soon after, she tendered her badge.



   

                   

Even my job seemed as dry

and bitter as a hot prairie wind.



   

                   

So here's Bill, walkin' down Nine Mile...

That's Bill Parker, you understand.



   

                   

He's got his sandwich in one hand

and a fuckin' head in the other!



   

                   

I even caught myself

drivin' by convenience stores



   

                   

that weren't on the way home.



   

                   

Then one day, the biggest news hit

the state since they buiIt the Hoover Dam.



   

                   

The Arizona quints was born.



   

                   

By ''Arizona quints''I mean they was

born to a woman named FIorence Arizona.



   

                   

As you probabIy guessed, FIorence Arizona

is the wife of Nathan Arizona.



   

                   

And Nathan Arizona... Well, hell,



   

                   

you know who he is.



   

                   

So come on down to Unpainted Arizona



   

                   

to get the finest seIection

in fixtures and appointments



   

                   

for your bathroom, bedroom, boudoir.



   

                   

And if you can find Iower prices anywhere,

my name ain't Nathan Arizona!



   

                   

Owner of the Iargest chain

of unpainted furniture



   

                   

and bathroom fixture

outIets throughout the Southwest.



   

                   

Yep, FIorence had been takin'fertiIity pills

and she and Nathan had hit the jackpot.



   

                   

Now, y'all without sin can cast the first stone.



   

                   

We thought it was unfair

some shouId have so many



   

                   

whiIe others shouId have so few.



   

                   

With the benefit of hindsight,

maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.



   

                   

But, at the time, Ed's IittIe pIan seemed

Iike the soIution to all our probIems



   

                   

and the answer to all our prayers.



   

                   

    leaf tables and no chairs?



   

                   

You can't sell leaf tables and no chairs.



   

                   

Chairs, you got a dinette set.

No chairs, you got dick!



   

                   

l ask my wife, she got more sense.



   

                   

Miles, alls l know is l'm away from the office

for a few days to play with my kids



   

                   

and everything goes

straight to heck! l won't stand for it!



   

                   

lf a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass

a-hoppin'. l am sick of your excuses, Miles!



   

                   

lt is now precisely...  :   in the p.m.



   

                   

l'm gonna be down that store in

exactly    hours to kick me some butt!



   

                   

Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!



   

                   

Sounds like Larry.



   

                   

No, no, no, no, no.



   

                   

Quiet, quiet, quiet.



   

                   

Quiet, quiet.



   

                   

OK, all right.



   

                   

Quiet, quiet, quiet.



   

                   

That's it. Good.



   

                   

Here's a rattle. A rattle.



   

                   

OK? Good.



   

                   

No, no. Quiet, quiet.



   

                   

Come here.



   

                   

Please come here. Come here.



   

                   

Why don't you go up and check on 'em?

They sound restless.



   

                   

- What's the matter?

- l'm sorry, honey. ltjust didn't work out.



   

                   

- What do you mean it didn't work out?

- Well, they...



   

                   

They started cryin' and they were all over me.

lt was kinda horrifyin', honey. Let me in.



   

                   

- Of course they cried. Babies cry.

- Well, l know that.



   

                   

- Come on, honey. We'd better leave.

- Go back and get me a toddler.



   

                   

l need a baby, Hi.

They got more than they can handle.



   

                   

- Honey, l...

- Don't you come back here without a baby!



   

                   

Christian Dior, my butt!



   

                   

- They pay money for that?

- Yes, dear.



   

                   

- How're the kids?

- Fine, dear.



   

                   

- Which one you get?

- l don't know. Nathan Junior, l think.



   

                   

- Gimme here.

- Here's the instructions.



   

                   

He's beautiful.



   

                   

Yeah, he's awful damn good.

l think l got the best one.



   

                   

l bet they were all beautiful.

All babies are beautiful.



   

                   

- This one's awful damn good.

- Don't you cuss around him.



   

                   

- He's fine, he is. l think it's Nathan Junior.

- We are doin' the right thing, aren't we, Hi?



   

                   

- They had more than they could handle.

- Well, honey,



   

                   

we've been over this. There's

what's right and there's what's right.



   

                   

- Never the twain shall meet.

- But don't you think his mama'll be upset?



   

                   

Well, of course she'll be upset,

sugar, but she'll get over it.



   

                   

She's got four little babies

almost as good as this one.



   

                   

lt's like robbin' convenience stores.



   

                   

l love him so much!



   

                   

- l know you do, honey.

- l love him so much!



   

                   

l know you do.



   

                   

OK. Bring him in!



   

                   

This is it, young Nathan Junior!

You can feast your eyes about, old boy!



   

                   

- Don't be so loud around him.

- Damn, l'm sorry.



   

                   

- Don't cuss around him.

- He don't know a cuss word from Shinola.



   

                   

- Well, you see that he don't.

- l wanna hold him too.



   

                   

- Well, mind his little fontanel.

- He's all right, he is.



   

                   

Come on over here, young Nathan Junior.

l'm gonna show you around.



   

                   

Lookee here, young sportsman.



   

                   

That there's the kitchen area,

where Ma and Pa chow down.



   

                   

This here's the TV. Two hours a day

maximum, either educational or football,



   

                   

so as you don't ruin

your appreciation of the finer things.



   

                   

And this here's the divan, for socialisin'

and relaxin' with the family unit.



   

                   

Yes, sir.

Many's the day we sat there and we said



   

                   

''Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster

to share our thoughts and feelings?''



   

                   

- He's tired, Hi.

- Well, l'll just sit you right there, boy.



   

                   

Just put those dogs up and take a load off.



   

                   

What, are you kiddin'?

We got us a family here!



   

                   

He's a scandal, honey. He's a little outlaw.



   

                   

No, he's a good boy.



   

                   

He ain't too good.

You can tell by that twinkle in his eye.



   

                   

- Don't you think we oughta put him to bed?

- Hang on, honey.



   

                   

- Let's just preserve the moment in pictures.

- Just one, OK?



   

                   

l gotta tell ya... l'm a little scared, Hi.



   

                   

- How come is that, honey?

- Well...



   

                   

We got a baby, Hi.

lt's an awful big responsibility.



   

                   

Honey, could you slide over a tad

and raise the nipper up?



   

                   

l mean, we never done this before

and l'm kinda nervous.



   

                   

You're doin' real good, sugar.



   

                   

- l love you, Hi.

- We're set to pop here, honey.



   

                   

- Now, you're gonna help, aren't you?

- How's that, honey?



   

                   

Contribute to the management of the child.



   

                   

- Quiet evenings together.

- You can count on it.



   

                   

Everything decent and normal

from here on out.



   

                   

We're set to pop here, honey.



   

                   

- OK.

- What is she?



   

                   

Station wagon. Looks nice.



   

                   

Open up! lt's the police!



   

                   

- Hi, what's goin' on?

- You stay in here.



   

                   

- Open up!

- They ain't gonna split up the family.



   

                   

- Open up in there!

- l'd like to see 'em try.



   

                   

Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea bargain!



   

                   

- Hi there, you old woodpecker!

- Boys!



   

                   

Gale, don't make me sick!



   

                   

Asshole!



   

                   

Honey, l'd like you to meet Gale

and Evelle Snopes.



   

                   

As fine a pair as ever broke and entered!



   

                   

Boys... this here's my wife.



   

                   

- Ma'am.

- Ms McDunnough.



   

                   

- Kinda late for visitors, isn't it, Hi?

- Well, yeah, honey.



   

                   

But these boys just got outta the joint,

so we gotta show a little hospitality.



   

                   

Well, now, H l. Looks like you've

been up to the devil's business.



   

                   

- Hey, is that a him or a her?

- lt's a little boy.



   

                   

- Got a name, does he?

- So far we just been usin' Junior.



   

                   

- We call him Junior.

- You mean JR, just like the TV show?



   

                   

- That's good!

- ''Welcome home, son.''



   

                   

Where's he been?



   

                   

- Phoenix.

- Tulsa.



   

                   

- He was visitin' his grandparents.

- They're separated.



   

                   

- That'd be your folks, ma'am.

- No, l'm afraid not.



   

                   

Well, you said your folks was dead, H l.



   

                   

Well, we thought Junior

should see their final restin' place.



   

                   

Why don't you boys have a seat?



   

                   

Hi, it's two in the mornin'.



   

                   

What's that smell?



   

                   

We don't always smell this way,

Ms McDunnough.



   

                   

l was explainin' to your better half

that, when we were tunnelin' out,



   

                   

we happened to hit the main sewer line.

Dumb luck, that.



   

                   

- And we followed that to...

- You busted outtajail?



   

                   

No, ma'am. We released ourselves

on our own recognizance.



   

                   

What Evelle is tryin' to say is we felt the

institution no longer had anything to offer us.



   

                   

- My Lord, he's cute!

- He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi.



   

                   

Now, listen, you folks can't stay here.



   

                   

- Ma'am?

- You just can't stay.



   

                   

l appreciate you bein' friends of Hi an' all,

but this is a decent family now.



   

                   

l mean, we got a toddler here.



   

                   

Say, who wears the pants round here, H l?



   

                   

- Honey, these boys just got outta the joint...

- Don't ''honey'' me!



   

                   

Now you boys can sit awhile and catch up,

but then you be on your way.



   

                   

Got you on an awful short leash,

don't she, H l?



   

                   

They still here?



   

                   

Yeah.

They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey.



   

                   

lt's rainin' out, they got nowheres to go...



   

                   

They're fugitives, Hi. How're we gonna

start a new life with them around?



   

                   

Well, now,

honey, you gotta have a little charity.



   

                   

You know, in Arab lands,

they'd set out a plate.



   

                   

Promise just a day or two.



   

                   

Tonight and tomorrow, tops.



   

                   

That night I had a dream.



   

                   

I drifted off, thinkin'about

happiness, birth and new Iife.



   

                   

But now I was haunted by a vision of...



   

                   

He was horribIe.



   

                   

The Ione biker of the ApocaIypse.



   

                   

A man with all the powers

of Hell at his command.



   

                   

He couId turn the day into night



   

                   

and Iay to waste everything in his path.



   

                   

He was especially hard on the IittIe things,

the heIpIess and the gentIe creatures.



   

                   

He Ieft a scorched earth in his wake,



   

                   

befouIin' even the sweet desert breeze

that whipped across his brow.



   

                   

I didn't know where he came from or why.



   

                   

I didn't know if he was dream or vision.



   

                   

But I feared that I myself had unIeashed him.



   

                   

For he was the fury that wouId be,



   

                   

as soon as FIorence Arizona

found her IittIe Nathan gone.



   

                   

d Father sits at his cabin door



   

                   

d Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes



   

                   

d For his only son soon shall walk



   

                   

d To yonder scaffold rise



   

                   

- You all right?

- Well, he's all right.



   

                   

He was just havin' a nightmare.



   

                   

d My race is run beneath the sun



   

                   

d The scaffold now waits for me



   

                   

d For l did murder that dear little girl



   

                   

d Whose name was Rose Connelly



   

                   

Sometimes it's a hard world for little things.



   

                   

Now, the missis and the rest

of the kids have left town



   

                   

to... l ain't sayin' where. They'll be back

here when we're a nuclear family again.



   

                   

- Mr Arizona, which tot was abducted?

- Nathan Junior, l think.



   

                   

- Anything to say to the kidnappers?

- Yeah. Watch your butts!



   

                   

lt's rumored your son

was abducted by UFOs.



   

                   

- Would you care to comment?

- Don't print that, son.



   

                   

lf his mama reads that,

she's just gonna lose all hope.



   

                   

Sir, we really need to

ask you some more questions.



   

                   

But remember it's still

business as usual at Unpainted Arizona.



   

                   

lf you can find lower prices anywhere,

my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!



   

                   

Mr Byrum here can take

your exemplars while you talk.



   

                   

Just relax your hand. l'll do the work.



   

                   

- What is this? l didn't steal the damn kid!

- Sir, these men are with the FBl.



   

                   

Are you crazy? Alls l know is,

l wake up and my wife's screamin'.



   

                   

We just need to distinguish your prints

from the perpetrator, if they left any.



   

                   

- Of course. l know that.

- Sir, were you born Nathan Huffhines?



   

                   

- Yeah, l changed my name. What of it?

- Can you tell us why?



   

                   

Yeah. Would you buy furniture

at ''Unpainted Huffhines''?



   

                   

- l'll get to the point...

- Was the child wearing anything?



   

                   

- Nobody sleeps naked in this house!

- l'll ask the questions!



   

                   

To put an APB out, l need a description.



   

                   

We're better trained to intervene

in a crisis situation. What was he wearing?



   

                   

A dinnerjacket. What do you think?

His damn jammies!



   

                   

- He was wearing his jammies. Happy?

- Any disgruntled employees?



   

                   

Hell, they're all disgruntled.

l ain't runnin' a daisy farm.



   

                   

- l say do it my way or watch your butt!

- So it might have been an employee?



   

                   

Without my say-so,

they wouldn't piss with their pants on fire.



   

                   

- What did the pajamas look like?

- l don't know. They were jammies!



   

                   

They had Yodas and shit on 'em.

Get your damn feet off my coffee table!



   

                   

- Ron, you are upsetting the victim!

- Are you boys gonna chase your leads



   

                   

or sit drinkin' coffee in the one house

in the state where l know my boy ain't at?



   

                   

Well, we don't have any leads as yet,

aside from the coat.



   

                   

Gimme that! That's a $    camel's-hair coat.



   

                   

Sir, you might want

to wash your hands at this point.



   

                   

Goddammit!



   

                   

No leads! Everyone leaves microbes and

whatnot. Hell, that's your forte, ain't it?



   

                   

Trackin' down microbes left by

criminals and commies and shit.



   

                   

That's your whole raison d'etre, ain't it?



   

                   

No leads! l want Nathan Junior back!

Or whichever the hell one of 'em they took!



   

                   

He's out there somewhere.

Somethin' leads to him!



   

                   

Anyone can find him knows the difference

between a lead and a hole in the ground!



   

                   

Awful good cereal flakes, Ms McDunnough.



   

                   

Why ain't you breast-feedin'?



   

                   

You appear to be capable.



   

                   

- Mind your own business.

- Ma'am,



   

                   

you don't breast-feed him, he hates you

later. That's why we wound up in prison.



   

                   

Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz tells us.



   

                   

Boys.



   

                   

Mornin', Hi.



   

                   

Hi...



   

                   

Oh, yeah.



   

                   

Say, boys...



   

                   

You wouldn't mind makin' yourselves scarce

for a coupla hours this afternoon, would ya?



   

                   

We're havin' some decent friends over.



   

                   

What Ed means to say is,...



   

                   

seein' as you two boys are wanted,



   

                   

it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein'

you here. lt's for your own protection.



   

                   

- Sure, H l.

- Anything you say, Hi.



   

                   

Matter of fact, honey,

l think l'll skip this little get-together myself.



   

                   

Glen won't mind. l'll just duck out with

the boys, knock back a coupla co-colas.



   

                   

- Sure, H l.

- We'd love to have you, Hi.



   

                   

Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either.



   

                   

So many social engagements,



   

                   

so little time.



   

                   

Where's that baby? Where is he at?



   

                   

- Go find him, honey!

- Cut it out, Glen!



   

                   

He's asleep right now.



   

                   

Shit! l hope we didn't wake it!



   

                   

Can l just sneak a peek-a-loo?



   

                   

Come on, kids!

Get away from Mr McDunnough's car!



   

                   

What's his name?



   

                   

Hi... Hi Junior, till we think of a better one.



   

                   

Why don't ya call him Jason?

l love biblical names.



   

                   

lf l had another little boy,

l'd name him Jason, Caleb or Tab.



   

                   

He's an angel!

He's an angel straight from heaven!



   

                   

Now honey, l had all my kids the hard way.



   

                   

Tell me how you got this little angel.

Did he fly straight down from heaven?



   

                   

- Well...

- You're gonna send him to Arizona State.



   

                   

Gimme a Twinkie!



   

                   

- You need a beer, Glen?

- Does the Pope wear a funny hat?



   

                   

Yeah, Glen, l guess it is kinda funny.



   

                   

Say, that reminds me. How many Polacks

does it take to screw up a light bulb?



   

                   

l don't know, Glen. One?



   

                   

No, it takes three.



   

                   

l told it wrong. l'll start again. How come it

takes three Polacks to screw up a light bulb?



   

                   

- l don't know, Glen.

- Cos they're so darn stupid!



   

                   

Shit, man! Listen up!

What's the matter? Don't ya get it?



   

                   

- No, Glen, l sure don't.

- Well, shit, man.



   

                   

l guess that's why they call it a way-homer.



   

                   

- Why's that?

- Cos you only get it on the way home.



   

                   

l'm already home, Glen.



   

                   

You wet yourself! You wet yourself!



   

                   

Mr McDunnough wet himself, Daddy!



   

                   

Say, that reminds me.

How'd you get that kid so fast?



   

                   

Me and Dot went to adopt -

somethin' wrong with my semen.



   

                   

They said we had to wait

five years for a healthy white baby.



   

                   

l said ''Healthy white baby, five years?

OK, what else you got?''



   

                   

They said they got two Koreans and

a Negro born with his heart on the outside.



   

                   

- lt's a crazy world.

- Someone oughta sell tickets.



   

                   

Sure. l'd buy one.



   

                   

That Buford's a sly one.

He already knows his ABCs. Watch this.



   

                   

Hit the deck, boy!



   

                   

But like l'm sayin', how'd you get the kid?



   

                   

Well, this whole thing is just who knows who.



   

                   

Then over here you have favoritism.



   

                   

Ed has a friend at one of the agencies.



   

                   

Maybe she can help me and Dot.

There's somethin' wrong with my semen.



   

                   

What you gonna name it?



   

                   

Ed. Ed Junior.



   

                   

- But l thought you said it was a boy.

- Well, as in Edward. We just like that name.



   

                   

lt's a good one.

l don't really need another kid,



   

                   

but Dot says these are

gettin' too big to cuddle.



   

                   

Say, that reminds me...



   

                   

Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai.



   

                   

Then there's diphtheria-tetanus,

what they call dip-tet.



   

                   

They need dip-tet boosters yearly,

or they develop lockjaw and night vision.



   

                   

Then there's the smallpox vaccine,

chicken pox and measles.



   

                   

lf your kid's like ours, you'll have to get

all those shots before he'll take 'em.



   

                   

- Who's your pediatrician?

- We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we?



   

                   

- No, l guess we don't have one yet.

- Jesus! Well, you gotta have one this instant!



   

                   

- What if the baby gets sick, honey?

- Even if he don't, he's gotta have his dip-tet.



   

                   

He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey.



   

                   

- You started his bank accounts yet?

- Have we done that? We gotta do that.



   

                   

- What's that for, Dot?

- His orthodonture and his university.



   

                   

Use iodine, you might save on orthodonture.

Won't knock a thing off the university.



   

                   

Riley! You take that diaper off your head!

You put it back onto your sister!



   

                   

Anyway, you probably got

the life insurance all squared away.



   

                   

Have we done that yet, honey?



   

                   

Gotta do that, Hi.



   

                   

- Ed's got her hands full with this angel.

- Yes, ma'am.



   

                   

What would Ed and little angel do if a truck

splattered your brains over the interstate?



   

                   

Yeah, honey. What if you get run over?



   

                   

Or you got carried off by a twister?



   

                   

Say, that reminds me. You hear about

the person of Polish persuasion?



   

                   

He walks into a bar with this

big pile of shit in his hand



   

                   

and says ''Look what l almost stepped in!''



   

                   

- Yeah, that's funny all right.

- Damn right! Shit, man, what's the matter?



   

                   

l don't know. Maybe it's...



   

                   

the wife, kids, family life. l mean...



   

                   

Are you satisfied, Glen?



   

                   

Don't you ever feel... suffocated?



   

                   

Like there's somethin' big pressin' down?



   

                   

Yeah, l do know that feelin'.



   

                   

And l told Dot to lose some weight,

but she don't wanna listen.



   

                   

No, man, l know what you mean.

You got all these responsibilities now.



   

                   

You're married, you got a kid,

it looks like your whole life is set down...



   

                   

- Where's the excitement?

- Yeah, Glen, l guess that's it.



   

                   

OK, that's a disease, but you got a cure.



   

                   

Yeah?



   

                   

Dr Glen is here to tell you

that you can heal thyself.



   

                   

- What do l gotta do?

- Well, you just gotta broaden your mind.



   

                   

Say if l was to ask you

''What do you think about Dot?''



   

                   

Well, she's a fine woman you got there.



   

                   

OK, now you might not know it

to look at her, but she's a hellcat.



   

                   

- That right?

- T-l-G-E-R.



   

                   

- Well, what's that gotta do with...

- Now, don't rush me.



   

                   

The thing about Dot is...



   

                   

She told me this. She thinks...



   

                   

She thinks you're cute.



   

                   

Yeah?



   

                   

l'm crappin' you negative.

And l could say the same thing about Ed.



   

                   

- What are you talkin' about, Glen?

- What am l talkin' about?



   

                   

l'm talkin' about sex.

What are you talkin' about?



   

                   

l'm talkin' about I'amour.

l'm talkin' that me and Dot are swingers.



   

                   

As in, to swing.

l'm talkin' about wife-swappin'.



   

                   

l'm talkin' about what they

call now ''open marriage''...



   

                   

Keep your goddamn hands off my wife.



   

                   

l was only tryin' to help! You're crazy!



   

                   

- You're crazy, man!

- Keep your goddamn hands off my wife!



   

                   

You're crazy! l pity you!



   

                   

We finally go out with some decent people

and you break his nose. That ain't funny, Hi.



   

                   

- His kids seemed to think it was funny.

- Well, they're just kids.



   

                   

You're a grown man with responsibilities.

Whatever possessed ya?



   

                   

- He was provokin' me.

- How'd he do that?



   

                   

- Never mind.

- But, Hi, he's your foreman.



   

                   

He's just gonna fire you now.



   

                   

- l expect he will.

- Where does that leave the three of us?



   

                   

Where does that leave our entire family unit?



   

                   

- With a man for a husband.

- That ain't no answer.



   

                   

- Honey, that's the only answer.

- That ain't no answer.



   

                   

With a man for a husband.



   

                   

Nathan needs some Huggies.



   

                   

l'll be out directly.



   

                   

Mind you stay strapped in.



   

                   

Wake up, son.



   

                   

l'll be takin' these Huggies

and whatever cash you got.



   

                   

''No, no, not by the hair on my

chinny-chin-chin'' said the little pig.



   

                   

Look at that. Look at him.



   

                   

''Then l'll...''



   

                   

''Then l'll huff and l'll puff

and l'll blow your house in.''



   

                   

That son of a bitch.



   

                   

That son of a bitch!



   

                   

- You son of a bitch!

- Better hurry it up. l'm in Dutch with the wife.



   

                   

You son of a bitch!



   

                   

Come on now!



   

                   

Honey?



   

                   

That son of a bitch.



   

                   

Hold on, Nathan.

We're gonna go pick up Daddy.



   

                   

Son, you got a panty on your head.



   

                   

Just drive fast, OK?



   

                   

Wait. There's the wife.



   

                   

Honey! Mind the baby now!



   

                   

Hang on, Nathan.

We're gonna take a short cut.



   

                   

Can l stop now?



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

That's private property, son.



   

                   

Come out to the street and reveaI yourself

to Officer Steensma and Officer Scott.



   

                   

Son of a bitch!



   

                   

Thank you, honey,

but you really didn't have to do this.



   

                   

Son of a bitch!

What if me and the baby had been picked up?



   

                   

- Turn left here.

- He'd be accessory to armed robbery.



   

                   

- lt ain't armed robbery if the gun ain't loaded.

- What kind of home life is it for a toddler?



   

                   

- You supposed to be an example.

- For what?



   

                   

l never postured myself as

a three-piece suit type. Turn right, honey.



   

                   

- We got a child now! Everything's changed!

- Nathan Junior accepts me for what l am.



   

                   

And l think you better had too.

You know, honey: l'm OK, you're OK.



   

                   

- That there's what it is.

- l know, but, honey...



   

                   

See, l come from a long line of frontiersmen.



   

                   

Here it is, dear.

Turn here. Frontiersmen and outdoor types.



   

                   

l'm not gonna live this way, Hi.

lt just ain't family life.



   

                   

Well, it ain't Ozzie and Harriet.



   

                   

You two are leavin'. l got nothin' against you,

but you're wanted by the authorities.



   

                   

And you're a bad influence

in this household in my opinion.



   

                   

Well, ma'am...



   

                   

We sure didn't mean to influence anybody.



   

                   

And if we did, ma'am, we apologize.



   

                   

l'm goin' tomorrow to see about shots for the

baby. When l come back, you better be gone.



   

                   

What's he need, his dip-tet?



   

                   

l'm awful sorry, boys, but when Ed gets mad,



   

                   

you know, she gets an idea.



   

                   

There ain't a thing to apologize for, H l.



   

                   

Seems pretty clear what the situation is here.



   

                   

Yeah. l guess the missis

wants us to clear out.



   

                   

Now, H l, if you'll pardon me for sayin' so,



   

                   

- l get the feelin' that this ain't workin' out.

- Edwina's generally a real sweetheart.



   

                   

And, as per usual, l wouldn't be surprised



   

                   

if the source of

the marital friction weren't financial.



   

                   

As a matter of fact, l did lose my job today.



   

                   

Hi, you're young and you got your health.

What you want with ajob?



   

                   

But l'd rather light a candle

than curse your darkness.



   

                   

Now, as you know, Evelle here and l never

go anywhere without there's a purpose.



   

                   

And here we are in your little domicile.



   

                   

- We come to invite you in on a little score.

- A bank, H l.



   

                   

Come on now!



   

                   

l know you're partial to

convenience stores, but dammit, H l,



   

                   

the sun don't rise and set

on the corner grocery.



   

                   

lt's like Doc Schwartz says,

you gotta have a little bit of ambition.



   

                   

We just watchin' on the news. Somebody

snatched up one of them Arizona babies.



   

                   

- For chrissakes.

- That there's somebody who's thinkin' big.



   

                   

And here you are, sittin' on your butt, playin'

house with a - don't get me wrong, H l -



   

                   

with a fine woman, but a woman

who needs one of them button-down types.



   

                   

- l don't particularly think that's any of your...

- Hold on, H l. Now lookee there.



   

                   

That's a picture of El Dorado.



   

                   

The locals call it the Farmers

and Mechanics Bank of La Grange.



   

                   

Looks like a hayseed bank.

Tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank.



   

                   

But the last Friday of every financial quarter,

it has more cash than flies at a barbecue.



   

                   

- And guess what day it is tomorrow.

- When all the hayseeds come in and



   

                   

cash their farm subsidies checks.



   

                   

- A  information, Hi.

- Got it in the joint



   

                   

from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of

Dick Nixon's undersecretary of agricultures.



   

                   

ln for soliciting sex from a state trooper.



   

                   

Ordinarily we don't associate

with that type of person, but...



   

                   

he was tryin' to make a few Brownie points.



   

                   

Boys, l can't.



   

                   

Hi, we need someone handy with

a scatter-gun, coverin' them hayseeds,



   

                   

while we go in there and get that cash.



   

                   

You understand, H l? lf this works out,

it's just the beginning of a spree



   

                   

to cover the entire Southwest. And we keep

goin' until we can retire... or we get caught.



   

                   

Either way, we're fixed for life.



   

                   

Boys, it's a kind offer, but...



   

                   

you're suggesting l just up and leave Ed.



   

                   

And that'd be pretty

damn cowardly, wouldn't it?



   

                   

Would it? Think about it, H l.



   

                   

Seems to me sittin' here

you ain't doin' her any good.



   

                   

And you ain't bein' true to your own nature.



   

                   

My dearest Edwina,



   

                   

tonight, as you and Nathan sIumber,

my heart is filIed with anguish.



   

                   

I hope that you will both understand, and

forgive me for what I have decided I must do.



   

                   

By the time you read this, I will be gone.



   

                   

I will never be the man

that you want me to be.



   

                   

The husband and father

that you and Nathan deserve.



   

                   

Maybe it's my upbringing.



   

                   

Maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up.



   

                   

I don't know.



   

                   

But the events of the Iast day

have showed ampIy



   

                   

that I don't have the strength

of character to raise up a famiIy



   

                   

in the manner befitting a responsibIe aduIt.



   

                   

I say all this to my shame.



   

                   

I will Iove you aIways, truIy and deepIy.



   

                   

But I fear that, if I stay,

I wouId onIy bring bad troubIe



   

                   

on the heads of you and Nathan Junior.



   

                   

I feeI the thunder gathering even now.



   

                   

lf I Ieave, hopefully,



   

                   

it will Ieave with me.



   

                   

I cannot tarry.



   

                   

Better I shouId go,

send you money and Iet you curse my name.



   

                   

Your Ioving -



   

                   

Herbert.



   

                   

Mr Arizona, he just barged in.

Should l call Duane?



   

                   

Hell, no. Why wake the security guard?



   

                   

l'll take care of this.



   

                   

- You got flies.

- l doubt it.



   

                   

This place is climate-controlled.

All the windows are sealed.



   

                   

- Who the hell are you?

- Smalls. Leonard Smalls.



   

                   

My friends call me Lenny.

But l got no friends.



   

                   

Stop. You're gonna make me bust out cryin'.



   

                   

Listen, Leonard... you want some furniture

or a shit-box, they're on the sales floor.



   

                   

l'm not a customer. l'm a man hunter.



   

                   

Now, of course, l do hunt babies on occasion.



   

                   

l hear you got one you can't put your hand to.



   

                   

- What do you know about it?

- That's my business.



   

                   

l'm a tracker, and some say part hound dog.



   

                   

But when some dink busts outta the joint,

skips bail, l'm the one they call.



   

                   

Mister...



   

                   

l got the cops, state troopers,

Federal Bl, already lookin' for my boy.



   

                   

- Now if you got information...

- The cops won't find your boy.



   

                   

A cop couldn't find his butt

if he had a bell on it.



   

                   

You wanna find an outlaw, you call an outlaw.



   

                   

You wanna find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.



   

                   

Smalls, first off,

get your damn feet off my furniture.



   

                   

Second off, it's widely known

l posted a   -grand reward for my boy.



   

                   

Now if you can find him, claim it.



   

                   

Short of that, what have we got to talk about?



   

                   

Price. Fair price.



   

                   

That's not what you say it is.

That's what the market will bear.



   

                   

Simple economics.



   

                   

Now there are people - and, mind you, l know

'em - that'll pay a lot more than $     



   

                   

for a healthy baby.



   

                   

- What are you after?

- l'll give you an idea.



   

                   

As a pup, l myself fetched

$      on the black market.



   

                   

That was      dollars.



   

                   

Now, for    grand, l'll track him



   

                   

and l'll find him.



   

                   

And the people that took him...

l'll kick their butts.



   

                   

No extra charge.



   

                   

- And if l don't pay?

- l'll get the boy regardless.



   

                   

And if you don't pay, the market will.



   

                   

You wanna know what l think?



   

                   

l think you're an evil man.



   

                   

l think this is nothin' but a goddamn

screw job. l think it's a shakedown.



   

                   

l think you're the one that took Nathan Junior



   

                   

and l think you're the one

that's gonna get his butt kicked.



   

                   

l think l'm on the phone

to the cops right now...



   

                   

Up and at 'em, H l!

Today's the first day of the rest of your life.



   

                   

Already you're messin' it up.

Missis gonna be back from town soon.



   

                   

- Where's the baby?

- ln the bedroom in his crib.



   

                   

He's sawin' toothpicks. He'll be fine.



   

                   

- You expectin' anyone?

- No.



   

                   

You two stay outta sight.



   

                   

- Mornin', Glen.

- l ain't comin' in, if you don't mind.



   

                   

l'll just keep my distance.



   

                   

- l didn't invite ya in, Glen.

- Don't even bother.



   

                   

- First off, you're fired, and that's official.

- l kinda figured that, Glen.



   

                   

Well, that ain't the reason

l come out here. No, sir!



   

                   

No. You're in a whole

shitload of trouble, my friend.



   

                   

- Why don't yajust calm down?

- Why don't you just make me?



   

                   

You know that little baby you got in there?

Remember? l know what his real name is!



   

                   

- You wanna keep your voice down, Glen?

- l'll pitch my voice wherever l please!



   

                   

His name ain't Hi Junior, it ain't Ed Junior,

but it's Junior, all right. lt's Nathan Junior!



   

                   

You stay away from me, McDunnough!



   

                   

Yeah. You're an awful big man when you

got somethin' around to clobber a guy with!



   

                   

- l ain't a big man.

- That's right.



   

                   

And now you're at my mercy.



   

                   

l'm your worst nightmare.

l was gonna turn you in for the reward,



   

                   

but Dot wants somethin' to cuddle.

l guess we'll be callin' the baby



   

                   

Glen Junior from now on!



   

                   

l'll give you a day to break the news to Ed!



   

                   

Dot'll be around tomorrow to pick him up.



   

                   

Either that, or you go to jail.



   

                   

Say, that reminds me.



   

                   

You'll be gettin' a doctor bill in the mail

in a few days. l recommend you pay it!



   

                   

- What's goin' on here?

- lt's just business.



   

                   

This'll go hard or easy, H l.



   

                   

Sweet Lord!



   

                   

d She'll be comin' round the mountain

when she comes



   

                   

d Oh, when she comes



   

                   

d She'll be comin' round the mountain

when she comes



   

                   

Good!



   

                   

l know you're worried, but we're gonna get

him back. There ain't no question about that.



   

                   

We will. That's all there is to it.

And another thing...



   

                   

l'm gonna be a better person from here on

out. That's the way it's gonna be. lt's official.



   

                   

You were right. A blind man could tell ya that.



   

                   

They won't hurt him.

They're in it for the score.



   

                   

But l'm a changed man.

You were right, l was wrong.



   

                   

We got a family here.

l'm gonna start actin' responsibly.



   

                   

So let's go, honey. Let's go get Nathan Junior!



   

                   

d All have chicken and dumplings



   

                   

d Yeah, we'll all have chicken

and dumplings when she comes



   

                   

l luuve to drive.



   

                   

- Boy, you sure said somethin' there, partner.

- Yes, sir.



   

                   

l figure between the ransom and this bank,



   

                   

you and l'll be sittin'

in the fabled catbird seat.



   

                   

Gale...



   

                   

Junior just had an accident.



   

                   

- What's that, partner?

- He had hisself a little ol' accident.



   

                   

- What do you mean? He looks OK.

- No, you see, movin' though we are,



   

                   

he just went and had hisself

a little old rest dump.



   

                   

Well, that's natural.



   

                   

- Gale?

- What now, little brother?



   

                   

He smiled at me.



   

                   

The kid smiled at me.



   

                   

Come here, boy. Nice.



   

                   

- Do you know how to put these things on?

- Around the butt and up over the groin area.



   

                   

Shoot, l know where they go, old-timer. l just

wanna know whether l need pins or fasteners.



   

                   

Well, no. They got tapettes already on there.

lt's self-contained and fairly explanatory.



   

                   

Balloons. Hey, these blow up

into funny shapes at all?



   

                   

Well, no, unless round is funny.



   

                   

l'll take these too.



   

                   

All right, now...



   

                   

Now you just lie down back there, old-timer.



   

                   

Yes, sir.



   

                   

All right, l want you to count up to...    



   

                   

- and then on back down to zero.

- OK, then.



   

                   

l'm gonna come back in five

and check to see you ain't cheatin'.



   

                   

- Hurry up!

- He's a cheerful little critter



   

                   

- once he warms up to you.

- l don't know how high this one can count.



   

                   

Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,



   

                   

eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi...



   

                   

Got some baby grub, baby wipes,



   

                   

got them diapers, them disposable kind.

l got me a packet of balloons.



   

                   

- They blow up into funny shapes at all?

- No, just circular.



   

                   

Say... where's Junior?



   

                   

- What do you mean? Didn't you put him in?

- No, l thought...



   

                   

Where'd we leave him?



   

                   

No!



   

                   

    Mississippi,     Mississippi...



   

                   

Junior!



   

                   

   ... Bullshit!



   

                   

    Mississippi...



   

                   

-     Mississippi...

- Baby! Baby!



   

                   

Baby! Baby!



   

                   

Promise we ain't ever gonna leave him, Gale.



   

                   

- Promise we ain't never gonna give him up.

- We ain't gonna give him up again, Evelle.



   

                   

He's our little Gale Junior now.



   

                   

Ed...



   

                   

l realize l can't be much

of a comfort to you now.



   

                   

But let me just say this:



   

                   

- You'll feel a whole lot better...

- l don't wanna feel better.



   

                   

- Honey...

- l don't care about myself anymore.



   

                   

l don't care about us anymore.



   

                   

- l just want Nathan Junior back safe.

- l know that.



   

                   

lf we don't get him back safe,

l don't wanna go on livin'.



   

                   

And even if we do get him back safe,

l don't wanna go on livin' with you.



   

                   

l guess l still love you, Hi.



   

                   

l... l know l do.



   

                   

l ain't even blamin' you.



   

                   

The whole thing was crazy

and the whole thing was my idea.



   

                   

- Well, factually, l myself bear a very large...

- Let me finish.



   

                   

Ever since those jailbirds took little Nathan,

l been thinkin' and l ain't too proud of myself.



   

                   

Even if Mrs Arizona had

more than she could handle,



   

                   

l was a police officer, sworn to uphold

the Constitution of the United States.



   

                   

- Now, honey, you resigned before we ever...

- That ain't the point, Hi.



   

                   

We don't deserve Nathan Junior

any more than those jailbirds do.



   

                   

- lf l'm as selfish and irresponsible as you...

- You're not that bad.



   

                   

lf l'm as bad as you,

what good are we to each other?



   

                   

You and me is just a fool's paradise.



   

                   

- There she is.

- Yup.



   

                   

Well... let's do her.



   

                   

- What are we gonna do with Gale Junior?

- He stays here.



   

                   

Are you crazy? Supposin' we go

in there and get ourselves killed.



   

                   

lt'd be hours before he was discovered.



   

                   

All right, you hayseeds, it's a stickup!



   

                   

Everybody freeze!

Everybody down on the ground!



   

                   

Well, which is it, young feller?



   

                   

You want l should freeze

or get down on the ground?



   

                   

l mean to say, if l freeze, l can't rightly drop



   

                   

and, if l drop,

l'm gonna be in motion. You see?



   

                   

- Shut up!

- OK, then.



   

                   

- Everybody down on the ground!

- You can forget that part about freezin'.



   

                   

- That is till they get down there.

- Y'all hear that, don't ya?



   

                   

You wanna fill this up, partner? We gotta...



   

                   

Shit! Where did all the tellers go?



   

                   

We're down here, sir.



   

                   

They're over there on the ground

like you commanded, Gale.



   

                   

l told you not to use my damn name.



   

                   

Can't you even try

to keep from forgettin' that?



   

                   

Not even your code name?



   

                   

Oh, yeah, yeah. My code name.



   

                   

Y'all hear that? We're usin' code names.



   

                   

All right, everybody. We're about

ready to begin the robbery proper.



   

                   

Hurry up, you dang hayseed!



   

                   

All right, now y'all know how this here works.



   

                   

That hayseed over there

with the red hat, he's the monitor.



   

                   

OK, you betcha.



   

                   

l want you to stay flat for ten full minutes.



   

                   

We mightjust come back in five to check.

That's for us to know and for y'all to find out.



   

                   

Anyone found bipedal in five

wears his ass for a hat.



   

                   

That old-timer threw off my concentration.

Otherwise it would have gone smoother.



   

                   

Shoot, Gale. We done good.

This oughta split up real nice three ways.



   

                   

Goddammit, you never leave a man behind!



   

                   

- Where's the baby?

- Where's the baby?



   

                   

Dammit, H l,

ain't we got enough to contend with?



   

                   

l don't know, ma'am. l thought we left him

up on the roof. l think we left him at the bank.



   

                   

Ms McDunnough, l'm worried sick about him!



   

                   

- Hold on, H l.

- l'm worried sick about him!



   

                   

- Hi!

- H l!



   

                   

- Hi!

- Ms McDunnough!



   

                   

- Let us come with you!

- Please!



   

                   

He's our baby too!



   

                   

- What is he?

- Do you see him too?



   

                   

Gimme that baby!



   

                   

l want that baby!



   

                   

Gimme that baby, you warthog from hell!



   

                   

Just lay down on the floor, young missy.



   

                   

- Run along now, honey.

- But Hi...



   

                   

Just run along now.



   

                   

l... l didn't...



   

                   

l'm sorry.



   

                   

What the hell's goin' on?



   

                   

Get away from there!



   

                   

- Let's go.

- Wait a minute. l ain't through with you.



   

                   

What are you doin'

creepin' around in the dark?



   

                   

- You in with Smalls?

- Excuse me?



   

                   

Leonard Smalls. Big feller. Rides a Harley.



   

                   

Dresses like a rock star.



   

                   

No, sir. That's who we saved him from.



   

                   

- lt's a long story.

- Suppose you tell it.



   

                   

Well, sir, in a reward situation,

they usually say ''no questions asked.''



   

                   

- Do they?

- Yeah.



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

All right, boy.



   

                   

l guess you got a reward comin'.



   

                   

$     .



   

                   

Or, if you need home furnishings, l can

give you a line of credit at any of my stores.



   

                   

ln fact, that's the way

l'd rather handle it, for tax reasons.



   

                   

We don't want no reward.

We didn't bring him back for money.



   

                   

We could work it that way too.



   

                   

Could l just look at him a little bit more?



   

                   

Be my guest, little lady.



   

                   

But...



   

                   

Would you mind tellin' me exactly how you...



   

                   

You took him, didn't you?



   

                   

lt wasn't that biker at all.



   

                   

l took him, sir.

My wife had nothin' to do with it.



   

                   

- l crept in yon window and...

- We both did it.



   

                   

We didn't wanna hurt him any.

l just wanted to be a mama.



   

                   

lt wasn't for money or nothin'.



   

                   

We just figured you had more

than you could handle baby-wise.



   

                   

But l'm the one committed the actual crime,

so if you need to call the authorities...



   

                   

Shut up. Nobody's gonna call

the authorities if there's no harm done.



   

                   

- Thank you, sir.

- Aw, bullshit.



   

                   

Just tell me why you did it.



   

                   

We...



   

                   

can't have one of our own.



   

                   

Well, look...



   

                   

lf you can't have kids,

you just gotta keep tryin'



   

                   

and hope medical science catches

up with you, like Florence and me.



   

                   

lt caught up with a vengeance.



   

                   

But, hell, even if it never does for you,

you still got each other.



   

                   

Sir, those are kind words, but...



   

                   

l think the wife and l are splittin' up.



   

                   

Her point is that we're both

kinda selfish and unrealistic,



   

                   

so we ain't too good for each other.



   

                   

Well, ma'am, l don't know much,

but l do know human beings.



   

                   

You brought back my boy,

so you must have your good points too.



   

                   

l sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me.



   

                   

l do... love her so.



   

                   

You can go out the way you came in.



   

                   

And before you go off and do

another foolish thing, like bustin' up,



   

                   

l suggest you sleep on it.



   

                   

At least one night.



   

                   

That night I had a dream.



   

                   

I dreamt I was as Iight as the ether,



   

                   

a floatin'spirit, visitin' things to come.



   

                   

The shades and shadows of the peopIe

in my Iife wrestIed their way into my sIumber.



   

                   

I dreamt that GaIe and Evelle had decided to

return to prison. ProbabIy that's just as well.



   

                   

I don't mean to sound superior,

and they're a swell coupIa guys,



   

                   

but maybe they weren't ready yet

to come out into the worId.



   

                   

And then I dreamed on, into the future,



   

                   

to a Christmas morning in the Arizona home,

where Nathan Junior was openin'a present



   

                   

from a kindIy coupIe

who preferred to remain unknown.



   

                   

I saw GIen a few years Iater,



   

                   

still havin'no Iuck gettin' the cops

to Iisten to his wiId taIes about me and Ed.



   

                   

Maybe he threw in one PoIack joke too many.



   

                   

I don't know.



   

                   

But still I dreamed on,



   

                   

further into the future

than I'd ever dreamed before.



   

                   

Watchin' Nathan Junior's progress from afar,



   

                   

takin' pride in his accompIishments,

as if he were our own,



   

                   

wonderin' if he ever thought of us,



   

                   

and hopin' that maybe we'd

broadened his horizons a IittIe,



   

                   

even if he couIdn't remember

just how they got broadened.



   

                   

But still I hadn't dreamt

nothin' about me and Ed,



   

                   

untiI the end.



   

                   

And this was cIoudier,



   

                   

because it was years, years away.



   

                   

But I saw an oId coupIe

bein' visited by their chiIdren



   

                   

and all their grandchiIdren too.



   

                   

The oId coupIe weren't screwed up,

and neither were their kids or their grandkids.



   

                   

Dad...



   

                   

And I don't know.



   

                   

You tell me.



   

                   

This whoIe dream.



   

                   

Was it wishfuI thinkin'?



   

                   

Was I just fleein'reaIity,

Iike I know I'm IiabIe to do?



   

                   

But me and Ed, we can be good too.



   

                   

And it seemed reaI.



   

                   

It seemed Iike us.



   

                   

And it seemed Iike,



   

                   

well... our home.



   

                   

lf not Arizona, then a Iand not too far away,



   

                   

where all parents are

strong and wise and capabIe



   

                   

and all the chiIdren are happy and beIoved.



   

                   

I don't know.



   

                   

Maybe it was Utah.
