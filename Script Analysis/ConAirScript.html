Army Rangers have

a proud history.



<P>

Since the 1700s, Rangers have led the

way in every major confrontation...



<P>

in which the United States

has been involved.



<P>

You men are a credit to that fine

heritage, and I'm sorry to see you go.



<P>

But you've served your country well,

and you've displayed the ability

to fight on...



<P>

to the Ranger objective

and complete its mission:



<P>

never leaving behind a fallen comrade

no matter what the odds or the enemy.





<P>

I thank you.



<P>

America thanks you.



<P>

And I wish you luck

wherever you go.



<P>

And remember,

Rangers lead the way.



<P>

- Hi, Tricia.

- Hey.



<P>

- Hey, Tricia Poe.

- Hello, Dale.



<P>

How do I



<P>

Get through one night

without you



<P>



If I had to live

without you



<P>

What kind of life

would that be



<P>

Oh, I



<P>

I need you in my arms

Need you to hold



<P>

- Hummingbird.

- Hi.



<P>

- You're my world, my heart and soul

- Look at you.



<P>

I'd take a beatin' half my life

to get a piece of that woman.



<P>

- How's my baby?

- She's doin' fine.



<P>

- Baby, you would take away everything

- Yeah?





<P>

- Good in my life

- What? You're kidding me!



<P>

- What?

- Sweetie?



<P>

Hey, shh. Can't you see I'm in

the middle of somethin' here? What?



<P>

- How do I live without you

- You, you gonna be Miss Alabama?



<P>

Well, that makes your daddy

very proud.



<P>

Oh, I know

How do I breathe without you



<P>

If you ever go



<P>

Tricia Poe!

You little angel, you.



<P>



Hey, how about joinin' me

and the boys for a cold one?



<P>

- Huh, darlin'?

- No, thanks.



<P>

Who's your

Captain Huckleberry here?



<P>

-You know this gentleman, honey?

-He's a regular.



<P>

Yeah, I'm a regular.

Huh. Regular hound dog.



<P>

This is a special occasion, and

if you don't mind, I'd like to

spend it dancin' with my wife.



<P>

Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't

you go buy me and my buddies a round?



<P>

Hey, Cameron, no.

It ain't worth it.



<P>

Hey. Come on, Daddy.

Let's dance.





<P>

Oh, chickenshit!



<P>

'Cause of pussies like you,

we lost Vietnam. I'll tell ya that.



<P>

- We don't need trouble.

- Oh, you should be so proud.



<P>

You know, for a second there

you were that guy again.



<P>

I know it.



<P>

Well, I was hopin' maybe the army

would make that guy grow up.



<P>

Well--



<P>

- He has.

- Then tell me now



<P>



How do I live

without you



<P>

I want to know



<P>

How do I breathe

without you



<P>

If you ever go



<P>

Hey, Gomer!



<P>

Thought you might need a little help

escortin' your old lady home.



<P>

Cameron, let's go home.

Just get in the car.



<P>

- Come on.

- Cameron!



<P>

Cameron, get in the car!





<P>

Dale! Dale!



<P>

Take this,

you son of a bitch!



<P>

Tricia!



<P>

Tricia!



<P>

God, he's dead.

Cameron, this guy's dead.



<P>

Admit the facts,

and enter a plea bargain.



<P>

I will not plead guilty.



<P>

You could get ten years.



<P>



Admit to it,

you get four.



<P>

Serve maybe a year.



<P>

Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty

to manslaughter in the first degree.



<P>

With your military skills,

you are a deadly weapon...



<P>

and are not subject to the same laws

as other people that are provoked...



<P>

because you can respond

with deadly force.



<P>

It is the order of this court that you

be remanded to a federal penitentiary...



<P>

where you shall remain incarcerated

for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.



<P>

Hello, pretty girl.





<P>

Come, come.

Bring it here. Hey! Hey!



<P>

Dearest Tricia, I think of you always.

Your smile, your laugh.



<P>

I'm not angry. The blame's

gotta fall on me.



<P>

I am, however, torn apart

when I think that I won't...



<P>

be there to see our child

come into the world...



<P>

cradled in your arms,

and her first smile.



<P>

I got your package.

Those pink coconut things...



<P>

have made me

quite popular.



<P>



Met a guy just the other day.

Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.



<P>

And now our daughter,

beautiful Casey.



<P>

I watch her grow

in the pictures you send.



<P>

I showed 'em to Baby-O.

His reaction was simple.



<P>

He said, "Thank God

she looks like her mama."



<P>

I'd have to agree.



<P>

It's funny, but here I am in maybe

the worst place on earth, and yet...



<P>

somehow I feel like

the luckiest man alive.



<P>

Dear Daddy, I started today at

the Little Sunshine Day Care Centre.





<P>

My teacher is Miss Gordon.

She is nice.



<P>

We go to playtime, and we all have

to hold hands when we walk there.



<P>

Dear Casey, it was so good

to read your letter.



<P>

I'm glad you like

your teacher.



<P>

We don't exactly have

a playtime like you.



<P>

We do go outside, though. But

normally, we don't hold hands.



<P>

My wife and I will have

our Margaritas on the yacht.



<P>

Dear Daddy, today was

my first day at first grade.



<P>



I didn't like it. I don't want

to go back tomorrow.



<P>

This boy, Scotty Dalton, has

black teeth and calls me names.



<P>

Mama says I have to go back.

Tell her not to make me.



<P>

Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you

still goin' to the first grade.



<P>

School is very important.

Your mama's right.



<P>

Now, don't you worry

about little Scotty Dalton.



<P>

Sometimes you meet people like that,

but don't let 'em get you down.



<P>

Dear Daddy, are you ever

comin' home?



<P>

Dear Casey, of course

I'm comin' home.





<P>

In just a little while longer, and all

the things we missed doin' together...



<P>

you can be sure

we'll do.



<P>

Dear Hummingbird, break out

the fine china, chill the lemonade...



<P>

tie a yellow ribbon

'round the old oak tree...



<P>

'cause this boy's comin' home to

his ladies, comin' home forever.



<P>

I just hope I'm not a disappointment

to Casey or to you.



<P>

Love, Cameron.



<P>

"My daddy is coming home

on July 14th.



<P>



My birthday

is July 14th.



<P>

I'm going see my daddy for the first

time ever on July 14th."



<P>

I can't wait to meet you, honey. Isn't

that the cutest thing you ever heard?



<P>

Yeah, man.



<P>

Hey, now,

what is this?



<P>

I can't see my little daughter

on her birthday without bringin'

her a gift, now can l?



<P>

Yeah, man,

but that's a bunny rabbit.



<P>

That's all right. I mean,

she'll like it, right? I mean, what?



<P>

It's either this or a tube

of toothpaste and two packs

of Pall Malls at the canteen.





<P>

- Now, that's a present.

- I'll remember that on your birthday.



<P>

Yeah, you do that, man.



<P>

"lt having been made to appear to

the United States Parole Commission...



<P>

Cameron Poe is eligible

to be paroled."



<P>

Shit, might be a long time before I see

somethin' like that with my name on it.



<P>

- You'll get your own date

someday, Baby-O.

- I ain't worried about that, man.



<P>

Yeah, but like at this new prison you're

goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?



<P>

God's got my back.

You know what I'm sayin'?



<P>



I'm goin' home, son!



<P>

Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy

on me, all right? Get off me.



<P>

Step out.



<P>

Goodbye.

Good night.



<P>

The U.S. Marshal Service

annually flies...



<P>

155,000 prisoners

around the country...



<P>

for transfers, legal hearings

and medical exams.



<P>

As you know, today's flight

is a special one.



<P>

We're populating Alabama's

Feltham Penitentiary...





<P>

the newest super-max facility

in the system.



<P>

This place was designed

to warehouse the worst of the worst.



<P>

Now, most of these guys

are lifers, some on death row.



<P>

Pure predators,

each and every one of them.



<P>

- Hey, lady!

- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.



<P>

My name is Bishop.

Guard Bishop to you.



<P>

Well, I gotta be gettin' my shot

before we go gettin' on

some aeroplane, Guard Bishop.



<P>

- What's your name?

- Odell. They didn't give me

my shot last night.



<P>



Okay, you're diabetic? All

right, your insulin's on board.

We'll give it to you in flight.



<P>

- Cameron Poe.

- Yes, ma'am.



<P>

You know you're still under full

restraints till you're processed...



<P>

and released from your original

prison, understand?



<P>

Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home

on time, it makes no never mind.



<P>

- It's my daughter's birthday.

- Well, congratulations.



<P>

I got locked down three months before

she was born. She ain't never seen me.



<P>

- And why not?

- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...



<P>

in a prison visitor room

surrounded by homemade cookies and...





<P>

and love-starved murderers.



<P>

- No way.

- What you got here is a walking,

talking reason to rehabilitate.



<P>

So today let's exemplify

our three operative words:



<P>

firm, fair and vigilant.



<P>

Now, let's go to work.



<P>

We off-load six in Carson City,

the rest are sheeted to Feltham.



<P>

Good. Let's go deal

with the DEA boys.



<P>

- You know this guy?

- Haven't had the pleasure.



<P>



He's a piece of work,

a real piece of work.



<P>

Duncan, good to see you.

She sure is beautiful.



<P>

Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.

Newborn babies are beautiful.



<P>

This, this is

fucking spectacular!



<P>

Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.

He's overseeing the transpo.



<P>

Vince,

Duncan Malloy, DEA.



<P>

Nice to meet ya. I'm sure

we're gonna have a good time

working on this together.



<P>

- Hey, Willie.

- Boys!

- How ya doin'?

- What's up, Chief?



<P>

- You know each other?

- Vince Larkin.

- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.





<P>

This is our file on your man,

Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...



<P>

prime mover of narcotics

from Colombia.



<P>

It's gonna be

an all-star flight.



<P>

This kid's a potential fountain of

information about the family business.



<P>

- Eleven and a half okay?

- Yeah.



<P>

Look at him.

Nice college boy, right?



<P>

We interrogated him for months.

He gave up nothing.



<P>

This is our last chance

before the FBI gets him.



<P>



Over my dead body

those assholes get the glory.



<P>

We pick up Mr Cindino

in Carson City.



<P>

From then until the plane hits Alabama,

we've got two hours to get him to talk.



<P>

We got you a seat right next

to him, and he's known to be...



<P>

somewhat garrulous

in the company of thieves.



<P>

Garrulous?

What the fuck is garrulous?



<P>

That would be loquacious, verbose,

effusive. How about "chatty"?



<P>

What's with dictionary boy,

here?



<P>

Thesaurus boy, I think,

is more appropriate.





<P>

- You got your gun?

- Yeah.



<P>

- Whoa, whoa. Gun?

- We got rules, gentlemen.



<P>

- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.

- No one carries on this flight.



<P>

I've got a small arsenal

in the belly of the plane.



<P>

A pistol in the cockpit

lockbox. That's it.



<P>

Other than that, we keep

the plane like a prison.



<P>

No weapon

on the aircraft, period.



<P>

My man does not get on

that plane without his gun.



<P>



Then your man

doesn't get on the plane.



<P>

Okay, Willie,

give it to him.



<P>

Give him the gun.



<P>

- Avoid eye contact.

- I got it.



<P>

- In the pen, it's a sign of aggression.

- Larkin, I got it.



<P>

Okay.



<P>

Foxtrot Charlie,

we are ready to disembark.



<P>

Waiting your go

on separatee transfer.



<P>

Well, we told you today's flight

would be special.





<P>

- That's William Bedford,

aka "Billy Bedlam."

- The mass murderer?



<P>

The same. He caught his wife in bed

with another man. Left her alone.



<P>

Drove four towns over

to his wife's family's house.



<P>

Killed her parents, her brothers, her

sisters, even her dog.



<P>

Scan him.



<P>

And who is that

good-looking brother on screen?



<P>

Nathan Jones,

aka "Diamond Dog."



<P>

Former general of

the Black Guerrillas.



<P>



He blew up a meeting of the National

Rifle Association saying...



<P>

and I quote, "They represented the

basest negativity of the white race."



<P>

He wrote a book in prison called

Reflections ln A Diamond Eye.



<P>

New York Times called it "A wake-up

call for the black community."



<P>

They're talking to Denzel

for the movie.



<P>

Close door number one.



<P>

This one's done it all.

Kidnapping...



<P>

robbery, murder,

extortion.



<P>

Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.

You are cleared to release.





<P>

His name is Cyrus Grissom,

aka "Cyrus the Virus."



<P>

Thirty-nine years old,

25 of them spent in our institutions.



<P>

But he's bettered himself Air inside. Earned

two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.



<P>

He also killed 11 fellow inmates,

incited three riots and escaped twice.



<P>

Likes to brag that he killed

more men than cancer.



<P>

Okay, open wide.



<P>

Lift your tongue.



<P>

Cyrus is a poster child

for the criminally insane. He's

a true product of the system.



<P>



What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what

is he, one of these sociology majors...



<P>

who thinks we're responsible

for breeding these animals?



<P>

No, but I could point a few fingers

if it would make you feel comfortable.



<P>

Ah, look at this walking penis.

Boy, you are one skinny Negro.



<P>

- Easy man. Shit.

- Open up.



<P>

Oh, man, it smells like

somebody shit in your mouth.



<P>

He told me he loved me.



<P>

- Get out of my face.

- All right, all right. Shit.



<P>

- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?

- That is Cameron Poe.





<P>

A parolee hitchin' a ride home.

He's a nobody.



<P>

Okay, let's do it.



<P>

Willie, nobody on the plane knows

your classification, not even my guards.



<P>

- Guard Bishop.

- Hey, Larkin.



<P>

Tell me, Skip, is

the U.S. Marshal Service...



<P>

in the habit of employing

annoying, wiseass bookworm creeps?



<P>

Larkin's one of the best

we got.



<P>

Yeah, well, I'd still like to

crush his larynx with my boot.



<P>



Scan him.



<P>

Face me.



<P>

- What's this shit?

- It's my daughter.



<P>

I don't care if it's

the weepin' mama of Christ.



<P>

There's no personal possessions

on this aeroplane.



<P>

Just as long as you know I'll be

gettin' that back at some point.



<P>

Are you tellin' me what I'm

gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?



<P>

- You heard me.

- Hey, hey, hey.



<P>

Come on,

break it up.





<P>

Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.

The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.



<P>

- Right here.

- Attention, officers.



<P>

- Final check, all restraints.

- Sweet bird of freedom.



<P>

Take off

in three minutes.



<P>

What's up, man?

Oh, shit. What's up?



<P>

I thought you was someone else.

Pinball Parker.



<P>

Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. I'm

a hell of a nice guy. I just got caught.



<P>

Aw, shucks.



<P>



- All right, face me.

- I got him.



<P>

Come on.



<P>

Open.



<P>

You guys are late

for the party.



<P>

- Okay.

- Let's go, sweetheart.



<P>

What's up, Cochise?



<P>

How?



<P>

Hey, man, I'm just fuckin' with you,

all right? Don't get all...



<P>

"Wounded Knee" on me

and shit.





<P>

You look like

you wanna scalp a nigger.



<P>

What you lookin' at,

punk?



<P>

Nothin'. I was just

admirin' your cage.



<P>

Fits you pretty good.



<P>

Well, welcome aboard.



<P>

My, my. As I look around I see

a lot of celebrities among us.



<P>

I see 11 Current Affairs,

two Hard Copies, and a genuine

Geraldo interviewee.



<P>

But I got to tell you,

gentlemen, none of this impresses me.



<P>



Because we have rules on this aircraft,

and they're gonna be enforced.



<P>

It's a lot like kindergarten.

You'll keep your hands to yourself Air.



<P>

You keep the decibel level down.

And if any of you should feel

the need to scream...



<P>

spit or bite,

you get the treatment.



<P>

- Fuck you, pig.

- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.



<P>

See, this kind of thing

puts me in a foul mood.



<P>

These rules will be enforced.

If there's a hint of trouble...



<P>

if any of you so much as passes

gas in my direction, it offends

my delicate nasal passages...



<P>

your testicles will become

my personal property.





<P>

That's pretty clear.

Good.



<P>

Call me Johnny 600

if they knew the truth.



<P>

Ah, doesn't have

quite the same ring to it.



<P>

Anyway,

I despise rapists.



<P>

For me, you're somewhere between

a cockroach and that white stuff...



<P>

that accumulates at the corner of

your mouth when you're really thirsty.



<P>

But in your case,

I'll make an exception.



<P>

- Guard Falzon.

- What?



<P>



Oh, stewardess, stewardess?

What's the in-flight movie today?



<P>

Well, I think you'll like it,

Cyrus. It's called...



<P>

I'll Never Make Love

To A Woman On The Beach Again.



<P>

And it's preceded by the award-winning

short, No More Steak For Me Ever.



<P>

Funny fucker,

aren't ya?



<P>

Hope this goes smoothly.

All those monsters on one plane.



<P>

Please, Ginny,

this is a well-oiled machine.



<P>

The only thing we gotta worry about is

stale peanuts and a little turbulence.



<P>

Close forward gate.





<P>

Close middle gate.



<P>

Come on,

I need my shot!



<P>

Coming. I'm coming.

Left arm.



<P>

Hey, Chief, if you come

through this all right...



<P>

hope you don't hold

a grudge.



<P>

What the fuck

are you doin'?



<P>

Get the extinguisher.

Open the middle gate.



<P>

The Last Mohican

is burnin', man!



<P>



Shit. Did you see that motherfucker,

man? He spontaneously combusted.



<P>

He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.

I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.



<P>

- Code red! Code red!

- Chantin' and shit.

- Fire in the rear cabin.



<P>

- I've got a fire.

- Where is it?

- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.



<P>

At first I thought he was singin'

Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.



<P>

Sh-Shit!



<P>

Holy shit!

Hold on, Bobby!



<P>

Gimme a Taser!



<P>

Hey, man,

get off my insulin!





<P>

Bobby, open the door!

Open the goddamn door!



<P>

Hey, hey, hey, hey,

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.



<P>

Pinball, go!

Pull the lever. Go! Go!



<P>

Pinball, behind you!



<P>

Get the gun out of the lockbox,

Mack. Go on back there, check it out.



<P>

Go! Go!



<P>

-Oh, my God.

-Say there was a disturbance

but everything's under control.



<P>

Say it,

or I will kill you.



<P>



Without me, you got nobody

to fly the plane.



<P>

I never think

that far ahead.



<P>

All right, I'm doin' it.

Just take it easy.



<P>

And if you say a word about this over

the radio, the next wings you see...



<P>

will belong to the flies buzzing

over your rotting corpse.



<P>

Uh, Carson City.



<P>

Hey! Hey!



<P>

Ladies and gentlemen,

this is your captain speaking.



<P>

I have the only gun

on board.





<P>

Welcome to Con Air.



<P>

- What happened?

- Roger that, Carson City.



<P>

Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,

and the pilot hit the alarm.



<P>

Just a little ruckus?



<P>

Pilot just checked in.

Everything's fine.



<P>

Transponder's confirmed,

and there's your baby.



<P>

Damn, this pig

is heavy!



<P>

Oops.



<P>



Shit.



<P>

If we let you out,

you gonna play nice, Billy?



<P>

Probably not.



<P>

I got a spot on my arm

just for you.



<P>

Hey, man, yo. Come on,

get off my medication.



<P>

I'm sorry, man.

The shit's in my way.



<P>

- I'm gonna use your whole body

to make me feel good.

- All right here, man. Come on.



<P>

All right, man.

Stop rushin'.



<P>

Ah, yeah.





<P>

No, no. Oh, no!

Make me hurt you.



<P>

- What you doin'?

- I can't allow that.



<P>

- You know what I am?

- Ugly all day.



<P>

This ain't happenin',

not here, not now.



<P>

- Oh, it's happenin'.

- Hey!



<P>

Relax. He's right.

Not here and not now.



<P>

- Do you fly, Johnny?

- No.



<P>

You keep that in mind

when you look at her...



<P>



because if your dick

jumps out of your pants...



<P>

you jump out

of this plane.



<P>

What are the numbers in Carson City?

How many on, how many off?



<P>

- Six off and ten on.

- Find the six.



<P>

Well, I know three of these brothers.

Th-They right back there.



<P>

Uh, the other three are

Benson, Carls and Popovitch.



<P>

- Where are they?

- That's a damn good question,

Cyrus. And I'm gonna find out.



<P>

The pilot wants to know

what's next.



<P>

He's to land at Carson City

Airport as scheduled.





<P>

Carson City? The law is down

there. You lost your mind?



<P>

According to my last

psych evaluation, yes.



<P>

Diamond Dog,

if you would.



<P>

You think you're free?

You're not. Now, listen up.



<P>

Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards

armed with shotguns are waitin'

for us at the next stop.



<P>

Now, if you do exactly

what we tell ya...



<P>

the rest of our lives will be a vacation

in a non-extradition country.



<P>

I'm talkin' sandy beaches,

umbrella drinks...



<P>



and dirty, naked freaks.



<P>

It'll be a paid

motherfuckin' vacation.



<P>

Wait. Who's doin'

the payin'?



<P>

Our employer,

Francisco Cindino.



<P>

Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,

no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.



<P>

Get that ass out here

right now!



<P>

- With you in a second.

- Right now!



<P>

- Keep cool, boss.

- Shut up.



<P>

- Who the fuck are you?

- I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am.





<P>

- Now you were saying?

- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.



<P>

So you think I give a shit

about that little bitch guard

you have there right now?



<P>

Well, maybe you didn't hear what

I said. I'm DEA. You know what

the fuck that means?



<P>

- Y-You the most crooked nigger

on this plane.

- Shut up.



<P>

You're DEA? What are you doin'

on this flight? Won't

they fly you boys commercially?



<P>

Don't push me, Cyrus, man.

I swear to God, I'll blow away

your little boyfriend right now.



<P>

You know, the next time

you choose a human shield...



<P>

you're better off not pickin'

a two-bit Negro crackhead.



<P>



- Hey!

- Shut up.



<P>

- Shoot him.

- Quiet, sweetheart.



<P>

- I think you should just stop.

- Stay back, man.



<P>

- Stay back!

- Just stop, right?

Before somebody gets killed.



<P>

- Back!

- All right, cowboy, I'm back.



<P>

- Stay back.

- You know you're in a situation

you can't control, right?



<P>

I can't control it?

I can't control it?



<P>

- You're a dead man.

- Shut the fuck up!



<P>

What's your name,

convict?





<P>

- My name?

- Yeah.



<P>

- Poe.

- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.



<P>

Nice goin', son.



<P>

Not only did you not save

this dude's life...



<P>

you done made best friends

with Cyrus the damn Virus.



<P>

Hey, Cyrus, l, uh, I got some good news

and I got some bad news.



<P>

-Yeah, what's the good news?

-Well, the goods news is I found

Benson, Carls and Popovitch.



<P>

- What's the bad news?

- The bad news is...



<P>



this dead fellow right here

happens to be Benson.



<P>

This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole

in his forehead is, is Carls...



<P>

and, and this honky

he's draggin' in is Popovitch.



<P>

I don't know how to tell

you this, Cyrus, but we are

three white guys short.



<P>

Or as they say in ebonics,

"We be fucked."



<P>

Look man,

I just wanna know.



<P>

All right, you didn't-- You

didn't mean that dirty-nigger

crackhead shit, did you?



<P>

Gimme that gun.



<P>

Hell, yes, I meant it.





<P>

Listen, Carson City is expecting

six men to get off this plane...



<P>

and we're gonna give 'em

exactly what they expect.



<P>

- So I need three volunteers.

- Come on, let's go, son.



<P>

- Don't look at me, pal.

- What about her?



<P>

I'm servin' eight consecutive

life sentences. I am not

getting off this plane.



<P>

I got my insulin, all right, but

they broke all the damn needles.



<P>

If I don't get my shot

in the next couple of hours...



<P>

- somebody gonna be sending

flowers to my mother.

- Hey, I'll go.



<P>



- I'm too old for his shit.

- I mean, no offence.



<P>

- I can take care of myself Air.

- I can see that.



<P>

Go ahead, go to the back.

Anybody else?



<P>

- Hey, right here, man. Us two.

- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.



<P>

Hey, whoa, stop. The guys

they're expecting are white.



<P>

That puts you

shit out of luck.



<P>

- Hey, come on, man.

- I'll tell you what. Sit down.



<P>

One of my associates will bring

you a phone book, and you call

the Affirmative Action office.



<P>

- You, go ahead.

- Yeah, that's it.





<P>

- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.

- No.



<P>

I'll get off,

scream to high heaven.



<P>

This plane won't leave

Carson City.



<P>

We need another white boy

to volunteer.



<P>

- Pilot's white.

- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?



<P>

- Who's gonna fly the plane?

- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.



<P>

- You rang?

- Carson City says we got a hell

of a sandstorm down there.



<P>

Perfect.



<P>



Crazy.



<P>

Vacant cell D8,

ready for inspection.



<P>

Last tenant,

Cyrus Grissom.



<P>

Got scratches on the wall.

Probably a weapon sharpening.



<P>

- What about the loose shCon Air screw?

- What the hell is this?



<P>

Looks like cocaine.



<P>

- What, do you got something there?

- I don't know. It's all soft.



<P>

What about the rest

of the pigs?



<P>

Be patient, now. They haven't

ceased to be useful yet.





<P>

Okay, old man.

Now you're Mr Popovitch.



<P>

Gentlemen, you'll reach the

Nevada pen in about two hours.



<P>

The tape's just a little

precaution in case any of you...



<P>

are rocked by the sudden impulse

to squeal like a pig.



<P>

Not that we don't trust you.

But let's face it, you're criminals.



<P>

- Come on, man, move your head up.

- I want to stay on.



<P>

What?



<P>

I changed my mind.



<P>



So, Cyrus, we got

a little mind-changer.



<P>

I got 15 years left, and

I know I'd just hate myself Air...



<P>

if I thought I blew my one shot

at a naked party freak...



<P>

and, and

an umbrella drink.



<P>

You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago

you couldn't wait to get off this plane.



<P>

I know.

Fear of freedom, I guess.



<P>

Get him up.

Get the cuffs off him.



<P>

Pick out a guard, and then put that

dead cop's prison issues on him.



<P>

- What the hell are you doin'?

- Stayin'.





<P>

They're gaggin' everybody

for the bus ride to the pen.



<P>

It'll be hours before the Feds discover

what happened. By then you'll be dead.



<P>

- So will she.

- Poe, think of your little girl.



<P>

Now, what would my daughter

think of me if I left you like

this to get dishonoured and die?



<P>

You keep acting like you're still

a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.



<P>

You're not that guy any more.

You're a convict.



<P>

Dear God!



<P>

- Told you I'd get that back.

- Fuck you, trailer trash.



<P>



Hey, my mama lives in a trailer. Now

put those on. I just saved your life.



<P>

Okay, soldier boy.

You got a plan?



<P>

Maybe.



<P>

Chief? I got a lot

of weird shit down here.



<P>

- What is it?

- This looks like the drawing

of a plane.



<P>

- Whose cell is that?

- The Virus.



<P>

Open up!



<P>

My daughter's picture. Where'd

you put my daughter's picture...



<P>

you shit-eatin'

peckerhead?





<P>

Heard you had a problem

up there.



<P>

Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.

Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.



<P>

On the bus, dickhead!

On the bus!



<P>

Let's go.

We're at the gate.



<P>

They took the plane. You hear that,

boys? We got the plane, man.



<P>

Shut the fuck up, curly, all

right? You gonna get us caught!



<P>

No way, Jose!



<P>

You gotta be kiddin' me.



<P>



Oh, boy.



<P>

In Spanish from Bogota, Colombia.

Looks like it's from a law firm.



<P>

Orange and black.



<P>

What's up, man?



<P>

- So, you the Swamp Thing?

- That's right.



<P>

- Flyin' the plane?

- That's right.



<P>

- It's amazing the shit

you white trash know.

- That's right.



<P>

Shit! Aw, man!



<P>

What're you doin' here?





<P>

Hello.

How you doin', baby?



<P>

I'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of

the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.



<P>

- Well, this is a restricted area.

- Look, don't worry, baby.



<P>

- It's all right. I'm a-- I'm a cop.

- You work for a prison or somethin'?



<P>

Yeah, the Department of Erect--

Corrections. Caught me slippin'.



<P>

Creepy.



<P>

The eyes are cut

out of their heads.



<P>

The Last Supper.



<P>



- Is that it?

- One more.



<P>

Late addition.



<P>

- Who?

- Garland Greene.



<P>

Should be interesting.



<P>

- What the fuck is that?

- That's Garland Greene, man.



<P>

Christ in a cartoon!



<P>

Shit, that's

Garland Greene, man.



<P>

The Marietta Mangler.



<P>

That skinny little man

butchered 30 somethin' people...





<P>

up and down

the eastern seaboard.



<P>

They say the way

he killed those people...



<P>

makes the Manson family

look like the Partridge family.



<P>

Well, he's on

the right flight.



<P>

- But you know what,

you really do need to leave.

- Tina, you've got...



<P>

the prettiest eyes I've seen

in about five to ten.



<P>

"Met ca-- Me--

Me. Et cetera.



<P>

Cetera. Meet."



<P>



Me, et cetera, me arson.

Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.



<P>

Meet cars. Meet cars.

Meet cars. Where?



<P>

"Carson...



<P>

City."



<P>

Oh, God. Uh, stay here.

Don't touch anything.



<P>

Hey, what're you doin'?

Just leave it alone. He told

you not to touch anything.



<P>

What the hell?



<P>

You wanna have some more fun,

keep it up.



<P>

Come on.





<P>

We've got a situation here, sir.

Somebody better call

the marshal's office.



<P>

Code red! Code red!

Starkey, those guards ain't guards.



<P>

- They're cons. Stall 'em.

- Christ!



<P>

- Hey, how are ya?

- Almost ready?



<P>

Won't be long now.



<P>

- You're the man, Cyrus!

- Let's go!



<P>

Do you hear somethin'

that sounds like a damn plane?



<P>

Jailbird One, you are

not cleared for takeoff.



<P>



Hey, nobody on this aircraft

gives a flyin' fuck!



<P>

Get it? "Flyin' fuck!"

Thank you. I'm here all week.



<P>

Hey! Hey, Cochise,

it's me!



<P>

Pinball. I'm sorry.

Hey!



<P>

Shine, sweet freedom,

shine!



<P>

Trust me, folks. This is gonna be

a day you will never forget.



<P>

Just step right on board

and find yourself Air a seat.



<P>

Don't they have a way

of tracking these planes?



<P>

Oh, yeah. It's called a transponder.

Every plane's got one, Cindino.





<P>

Swamp, where is

the transponder?



<P>

Where indeed?



<P>

Are, are you sure it's safe

to fly in this?



<P>

No problem. I've done this

a thousand times. We'll be

through this in a few minutes.



<P>

You all right back there,

ladies?



<P>

We're following the transponder.

We know exactly where they're heading.



<P>

What the fuck happened?



<P>

What about Sims?

What happened to Sims?



<P>



Duncan,

they killed him.



<P>

They got the plane.



<P>

Tell me, Skip, what kind

of a Keystone Cops operation

are you guys runnin' here, huh?



<P>

And you! You, you little shit.

You got my agent killed!



<P>

Hey, he brought a gun

on the plane.



<P>

If I knew the way you guys

run things, I would've told him

bring a fuckin' uzi on board!



<P>

No one carries on these flights!

No one!



<P>

He brought a gun on board

and he got himself Air killed.



<P>

And in doing so, he compromised

the safety of my men!





<P>

Your men are incompetent!



<P>

They let themselves get taken over by

a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!



<P>

- I'm not gonna stand around...

- Guys!

- and listen to this shit!



<P>

Guys, guys.

Let's work it out.



<P>

Okay. Okay.



<P>

So, uh,

what do we do now?



<P>

What's the plan? You, uh,

you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?



<P>

We're workin' on it.



<P>



Contingency plans for something

like this don't exist.



<P>

- The situation's never

been contemplated.

- Well, you better start

contemplating...



<P>

'cause this is a situation that

needs to get unfucked right now!



<P>

I want a chopper. Make that a few

of 'em. They need to be armed.



<P>

I don't care if it's National

Guard, Air Force, whatever.



<P>

Just get 'em here,

and get 'em here now.



<P>

- What do you want to do with him?

- I don't know.



<P>

But this is no way to treat

a national treasure. Let him out.



<P>

- You sure?

- Love your work.





<P>

They're headed southeast

toward Arizona.



<P>

- Pinball didn't make it.

- No?



<P>

That's too bad.

I liked Pinball.



<P>

- What do you want?

- I wanna know what the plan is.



<P>

Why you care?



<P>

I got just as much ridin' on this

as you. We're all convicts here.



<P>

Cyrus Grissom,

do you copy?



<P>

Cyrus Grissom,

do you copy?



<P>



Yes, I copy.

Identify yourself Air.



<P>

This is United States Marshal Vince

Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.



<P>

Oh, Agent Malloy. I'm so sorry

about your associate.



<P>

Nothing is quite as sad as seeing

a grown man pissing his pants.



<P>

Listen, Grissom,

you puny, fucking animal!



<P>

When I get through with you, you'll be

beggin' 'em for the electric chair.



<P>

Hey, I don't like him.



<P>

If he speaks again, this

conversation is terminated.



<P>

He doesn't want to talk again.

Really. He's done talking.

He's leaving the building, okay?





<P>

Good, then I'll talk to you.

Here are the rules.



<P>

First I ask a question,

then you ask a question.



<P>

Okay.

What's your question?



<P>

In Carson City, your bulls

were onto us. How?



<P>

- One of the guards--

- One of the guards--



<P>

One of the guards faked a heart attack

and we had to remove his restraints.



<P>

All right?



<P>

I see.

And what's your question?



<P>



Where you goin'

with my plane, Cyrus?



<P>

- We're going to Disneyland.

- You're lying, Cyrus.



<P>

So are you, Vince.

Oh, nothin'



<P>

Makes me sadder than the agent

lost his bladder in the



<P>

Aeroplane



<P>

Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.

That's our rendezvous point.



<P>

Forty-nine minutes from anything

resembling authority.



<P>

So, now you know.



<P>

Your attention, please.

Flight 475--





<P>

You excited? Yeah?

Sure look pretty.



<P>

- Mrs Poe?

- That's right.



<P>

My name's Grant,

U.S. Marshal Service.



<P>

There's been a slight problem

on your husband's flight.

Your presence is requested.



<P>

I have a jet

standing by.



<P>

Yee-ha!

What's on your mind, hillbilly?



<P>

What was I thinking about?



<P>

Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.

That's right.



<P>



I was just wonderin' what a black

militant, uh, that would be you...



<P>

was doin' takin' orders from

a white boy on a power trip.



<P>

-Don't you think that's strange?

-It's a means to an end,

my white friend.



<P>

A means to an end.

See...



<P>

I's can play house nigger till's

we get to where we're goin'.



<P>

And then,

the day of the dog begins.



<P>

So what was that

all about?



<P>

Oh, nothin',

except they somehow managed...



<P>

to get every creep and freak

in the universe onto this one plane...





<P>

and then somehow managed

to let them take it over...



<P>

and then somehow managed to stick us

right smack in the middle.



<P>

Hi, Garland.



<P>

Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.

His wife's on the way here now.



<P>

U.S. Ranger,

highly decorated.



<P>

Did a little hell-raising when

he was a kid, but nothing serious.



<P>

Explain to me

why any of this matters.



<P>

Fact one. We got a plane up there filled

with killers, rapists and thieves...



<P>



and we got this guy Cameron Poe,

in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.



<P>

Non-gang affiliated. He's

a parolee hitchin' a ride home.



<P>

Fact two. Poe has a chance

to get off the plane.



<P>

Doesn't do it. Why?



<P>

Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,

said a convict named Cameron Poe...



<P>

planted Sims's

tape recorder on him.



<P>

These are interesting facts.

You do the math on this, and

we got an ally on that plane.



<P>

Ally? This guy is a criminal.

A murderer.



<P>

Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl

defending his wife and he killed a guy.





<P>

Could have happened to any one

of us, including you and me.



<P>

I am not one

of these animals.



<P>

Oh, that's original! When exactly

did they all become animals?



<P>

When they stopped giving a damn

about the law, about civilization.



<P>

"The degree of civilization

in a society can be judged

by observing its prisoners."



<P>

Dostoevsky said that

after doing a little time.



<P>

"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom

said that after putting a bullet

in my agent's head. Okay?



<P>

The issue here is how the plane

is brought down.



<P>



Shoot it down.



<P>

Yeah. When exactly did this

become a DEA jurisdiction?



<P>

The second the DEA agent

was murdered.



<P>

I am authorized to bring Agent Sims's

killers to justice using...



<P>

and I quote,

"All necessary means."



<P>

- That does not include

shooting down my plane.

- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.



<P>

Is that right? Tell me you're

not seriously entertaining this.



<P>

Vince, this is

a drastic situation we got.



<P>

-Those are our men up there!

-All of whom signed a no-hostage

clause. They know the score.





<P>

Who are you to decide the value

of a man's life? There are

innocent people up there!



<P>

About time.



<P>

-For what? About time for what?

-Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.



<P>

Goddamn it!

Skip, don't do this!



<P>

This man is in an irrational state

of mind! His head isn't on straight.



<P>

Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.

Your job's finished. This flight's full.



<P>

Gentlemen, in roughly

five hours, we will be flying

over the shores of Mexico.



<P>

But first we have

to change aircraft.



<P>



Thank you, and have

a pleasant flight.



<P>

- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?

- At 228 miles an hour,

about 71 minutes.



<P>

The only problem is, we're not doing

228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.



<P>

We're draggin', baby.

The landing gear ain't all

the way up. We're gonna be late.



<P>

- No, no, no. Cyrus,

that's unacceptable.

- Check out the gear.



<P>

- What the hell do I know

about landing gear?

- Learn.



<P>

Hillbilly!



<P>

Poe.



<P>

- Yeah?

- Cyrus wants you to check out

the landing gear.





<P>

Then I'll get to see some nice

scenery whippin' by down there.



<P>

Trees and stuff.



<P>

Goddamn! So that's

what happened to Pinball.



<P>

Cut him loose. He's slowin'

us down. Dead weight.



<P>

Not exactly

a proper burial.



<P>

Look at our shit

over there.



<P>

Hurry up.



<P>

Hillbilly.



<P>



Gotcha.



<P>

Hurry up, man.



<P>

Bye, Pinball.



<P>

Oh, boy! You see that?

You see?



<P>

Every time we get her waxed,

I get ten feet from the car wash

and then, pow, bird shit.



<P>

Well, it's supposed to be

good luck.



<P>

- Light's changed.

- Oh, damn.



<P>

- You were in the "Q," right?

- Yeah.



<P>

And I heard you say

you had 15 years.





<P>

That's right.



<P>

But then that would put you

on north block. Right?



<P>

Yeah.



<P>

Yeah. Funny thing.



<P>

I was on north block.

I don't know you.



<P>

Well, you know what,

uh, pal?



<P>

What do you think that means?

Nothin'. Not diddly shit.



<P>

You see, there were 160 cats

on north block...



<P>



and I didn't want to know 159

of them, which included you.



<P>

What do you think

about that?



<P>

Yeah.



<P>

He's a font

of misplaced rage.



<P>

Name your cliche. Mother held

him too much, or not enough.



<P>

Last picked at kick ball,

late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.



<P>

Now he's so angry, moments of

levity actually cause him pain.



<P>

Gives him headaches.



<P>

Happiness, for

that gentleman, hurts.





<P>

What's wrong with him?



<P>

My first thought would be

a lot.



<P>

- Hello.

- Hello.



<P>

- Hi. I'm, I'm Vince Larkin.

- I'm Tricia Poe.



<P>

Nice to meet ya.

This, this must be Casey.



<P>

- Hello, Casey.

- Hello, Vince Larkin.

- Nice to meet ya.



<P>

So how are you doin'?



<P>

I'm sorry. That's, uh-- Scratch

that. Dumb question. You--



<P>



You wanted to see your husband today,

and then this whole thing happened.



<P>

Maybe you could just tell me

exactly what's going on here and--



<P>

We're doing everything we can

to get the plane down.



<P>

Actually, that's w-why I wanted

to talk to you.



<P>

Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get

the rims, man?



<P>

My personal shit's

down in the belly.



<P>

- Hey, those are my shades.

- They're mine now, sister.



<P>

Men!



<P>

It seems that your husband,

Cameron...





<P>

had an opportunity to get off

the plane and he didn't do it.



<P>

And I was hoping

you could...



<P>

maybe help me

figure out why.



<P>

That would make two of us.

I don't know.



<P>

I mean, it's possible,

it's, it's not uncommon...



<P>

that some parolees actually fear

their release date.



<P>

A certain degree of institutionalization

sets in. Fear of coming home.



<P>

- Fear of living in society.

Any of this make sense?

- No, no.



<P>



That's not Cameron. I mean, if you, if

you knew him, if you read his letters...



<P>

or if you talked to him

on the phone, you'd know that--



<P>

I mean, he's been waitin' for this day

for eight years. He's not gonna--



<P>

I mean, look, he's got this little,

this little girl to come home to.



<P>

Wouldn't you...



<P>

do the same thing?



<P>

There'd have to be a pretty strong

reason to keep me on that plane.



<P>

Well, knowing Cameron,

I'm sure there is a good reason.



<P>

Uh, maybe, if you, if you do

see him or if you talk to him...





<P>

maybe you could just tell him

to come home, all right?



<P>

Be kinda nice

to have him around.



<P>

You got it.



<P>

Vince, line one.



<P>

This body fell out

of the sky.



<P>

Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,

Fresno Police Department.



<P>

We got a problem here

with a corpse.



<P>

Yeah, it fell out

of the sky.



<P>



I don't think

he's an astronaut.



<P>

Then what's this got

to do with me?



<P>

It's got your name

written all over it.



<P>

Last transponder tag

was in Arizona.



<P>

Body falls here,

in Fresno.



<P>

Lerner Airfield.

They're turning around.



<P>

- They're coming back.

Can you get me Chief--

- Devers.



<P>

Please. Thank you.



<P>

- Vince?

- Turn around.





<P>

Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. It's

a small strip about 100 miles from here.



<P>

Horseshit! We're tailing the

transponder tag into Arizona.



<P>

Listen to me.

A body fell from the sky.



<P>

It had a note on it.



<P>

We got 'em vectored

at 12:00 and 30 miles.



<P>

- Vince, please, son.

We're right on his tail.

- Just listen to me!



<P>

It was to me!

The note on the body was to me!



<P>

- You're chasing the wrong--

- Aw, shut up.



<P>



Hello?



<P>

Guys, guys! I need a plane

or a chopper now!



<P>

Hey, you and me both.

I'm all out.



<P>

I've got to get to Lerner Airfield

and I've got about 50 minutes.



<P>

Got a fast car,

you can drive it.



<P>

Larkin. Vince Larkin.

I'm with the Marshal Services.



<P>

Send whatever you got. Sheriff,

state trooper, national guard.



<P>

Hold on one minute.



<P>

Your men should proceed

with extreme caution.





<P>

It's only a matter of time

before they find the weapons hold.



<P>

Larkin. Vince Larkin.

Marshal Services.



<P>

How do you think

I got the number?



<P>

"...appears to the United States

Parole Commission that--"



<P>

Poe.



<P>

Man! Oh, yeah!



<P>

Put the bunny

back in the box.



<P>

I knew you was a punk.

And I was right.



<P>



You been playin' us

all along.



<P>

You a free man.



<P>

I said, put the bunny...



<P>

back in the box.



<P>

Die, punk!



<P>

Why couldn't you put the bunny

back in the box?



<P>

Next, folks, below and to your left,

you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.



<P>

We're seconds away from

establishing visual contact.



<P>

Holy shit!





<P>

Abort! Abort! Abort!



<P>

If that aircraft's carrying

30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.



<P>

"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."



<P>

Shit!



<P>

Three hundred fuckin' miles

to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!



<P>

We need to get

to Lerner Airfield now!



<P>

Get me Vince Larkin.



<P>

Two went down,

one came up.



<P>



- Wasn't my fault.

- Well, you don't have to tell me.



<P>

Most murders are crimes

of necessity rather than desire.



<P>

But the great ones,

Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...



<P>

- they did it because it excited them.

- Don't you--



<P>

I got nothing in common

with them, with you.



<P>

Don't you talk to me!

They were insane.



<P>

Now you're talking

semantics.



<P>

What if I told you insane

was working 50 hours a week

in some office for 50 years...



<P>

at the end of which

they tell you to piss off?





<P>

Ending up

in some retirement village...



<P>

hoping to die before suffering

the indignity of trying to make

it to the toilet on time.



<P>

Wouldn't you consider that

to be insane?



<P>

Murdering 30 people,

semantics or not, is insane!



<P>

One girl...



<P>

I drove through three states

wearing her head as a hat.



<P>

It's my daughter's birthday

today.



<P>

So please feel free

not to share everything with me.



<P>



All right, you damn peckerwoods,

crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.



<P>

We're putting this baby

down in a sandbox.



<P>

Lerner Tower,

do you copy?



<P>

Lerner Tower,

are you there, Phil?



<P>

Come on, answer me.



<P>

I am landing.



<P>

Oh, my God.



<P>

Look out!



<P>

Lerner Airfield.

I'm so glad to be here.





<P>

Thank you

for choosing Con Air.



<P>

- Where's the plane, Francisco?

- I don't know. Have patience.



<P>

The last guy who told me to have

patience? I burned him down,

and bagged his ashes.



<P>

Cyrus, it'll be here.



<P>

Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!

Jesus Christ!



<P>

I hope he likes sand.



<P>

-Muchacho, run and check out the

tower. Have a look-see, yeah?

-All right.



<P>

You come with us.



<P>



- Let's go. We're gettin' off.

- Boss, I can't.

- Yes, you can. Come on!



<P>

- You shouldn't move him.

- I'm getting him off of this plane.



<P>

You, you can't move him. He's

too far along. He could go into shock.



<P>

She's right, Poe.

Go on, man.



<P>

I'm not leaving

without you, or you.



<P>

Ah, listen. Here we go.

Ranger boy.



<P>

- Right.

- Goddamn it, Poe!



<P>

Man, it's time to fight,

fuck or hit the fence.



<P>

- I suggest you hit the fence.

- He's right.





<P>

Just go.



<P>

All right. Here's how it's gonna play.

I'm gonna get you that needle.



<P>

Whatever you say, man.

Just do what you gotta do.



<P>

Fuck.



<P>

All right, you just hang on.

Don't die on me.



<P>

Swing low, sweet chariot



<P>

Comin' for

to carry me home



<P>

Oh, no. What the hell

you think you're doin'?



<P>



- It's time to off the pigs.

- You can't do that.



<P>

- Tell me why.

- They're hostages. We need 'em.



<P>

- But why the fuck you care?

- Hey, man, come on.



<P>

I can't think of a thing

I'd like better...



<P>

than to put a bullet in the brain base

of every one of these fuckers!



<P>

But the fact of the matter is,

how well you know this Cindino?



<P>

I mean, I don't know him that

well myself Air. Just what I read.



<P>

Like how he firebombed

that senator's yacht with two

of his own cousins on board.



<P>

So what's your point?





<P>

Why would he sweat

about killing some hired guns

once they'd served his purpose?



<P>

- Now think about that.

- What exactly are we discussing here?



<P>

Poe don't want me

to off the pigs.



<P>

Well, it's not difficult to surmise how

Nathan here feels about killing guards.



<P>

And my own proclivities

are, uh...



<P>

well-known and, uh,

often-lamented facts of penal lore.



<P>

What I'm wonderin' is why you have

any opinion about it at all.



<P>

Cyrus, this is your barbecue,

man, and it tastes good.



<P>



But I was just sayin' to Mr Dog over

here, that if it was my barbecue...



<P>

I'd wait for that old jumbo jet

in the sky before I start

killin' our only leverage.



<P>

- Shut the fuck up!

- Don't you want to get high

and get laid?



<P>

- Shit.

- Oh, fuck this!



<P>

Put the gun down.

Put the gun down, Nathan.



<P>

Poe's right.

We're goin' to Plan "B."



<P>

Gonna get a refuelling truck

and a tractor.



<P>

So get back there

and dig the plane out.



<P>

No. Yes!





<P>

- Viking, 'bout time to go

and get that tractor, yeah?

- Right.



<P>

- I'll get the fuel truck.

- Thanks, Poe.



<P>

You've proven to be

a most useful mammal.



<P>

"Many hands make light work."

My daddy taught me that.



<P>

- You know what my daddy taught me?

- What's that?



<P>

- Nothin'.

- SCon Air-educated man.



<P>

-Have you found Vince Larkin?

-We're having trouble reaching him, sir.



<P>

Of course, you're having trouble

reaching him!



<P>



He's off saving the rain forest

or recycling his sandals or some shit.



<P>

Holy shit!



<P>

Hey! We've got company!



<P>

Hey!



<P>

We've got company!



<P>

Go get Cyrus.



<P>

Yo, Cyrus!



<P>

How long we got

till they get here, Nathan?



<P>

Ten, twelve minutes, tops.





<P>

Hey, what's your name?

Wanna play?



<P>

Nice jet.



<P>

You can take Cindino and leave

the rest to rot for all I care.



<P>

You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off

prisoners are gonna hear it.



<P>

Well, hooray for the sounds

of fuckin' silence.



<P>

Freeze!



<P>

- You're Cameron Poe.

- That's right.



<P>

- I'm Larkin.

- Hello, Larkin.



<P>



- I got your message.

- Where are the troops?



<P>

- They'll be here.

- "They'll be here"?



<P>

Uh-huh. In a minute.



<P>

Listen, Poe,

can I lower this?



<P>

- Go ahead.

- You gonna lower yours?



<P>

Sorry, boss, but there's only

two men I trust.



<P>

One of them's me.

The other's not you.



<P>

- So Cindino was running

a drag on everyone.

- Yeah.



<P>

If you can't trust a South American

drug lord, who can you trust, huh?





<P>

- That was a joke.

- I'm glad you told me. Now

I gotta get back to the plane.



<P>

You're a free man, Poe.

What are you doin'?



<P>

I can't trade a friend's life

for my own, Larkin. That's all.



<P>

You got a friend on board?



<P>

See, I knew I was right

about you. I read your file.



<P>

You're not such a bad guy. Just always

in the wrong place at the wrong time.



<P>

Goodbye, Larkin.



<P>

I spoke to your wife.



<P>



- In person?

- In person.



<P>

And your little girl.



<P>

You saw Casey?



<P>

If this thing goes bad, Larkin,

I'm afraid my daughter...



<P>

won't understand.



<P>

If you talk to my wife again,

you tell her...



<P>

I love her.



<P>

She's my hummingbird.



<P>

But I couldn't leave

a fallen man behind.





<P>

You'll do that for me,

won't you, Larkin?



<P>

Sure I will.

What are you gonna do for me?



<P>

What do you think

I'm gonna do?



<P>

I'm gonna save

the fuckin' day.



<P>

Let's go, gentlemen.

The cavalry is on its way.



<P>

- I want this aeroplane out now.

- Come on, men!



<P>

- About another ten minutes.

- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.



<P>

Hello, Bob.

Wanna come over for dinner?



<P>



Are you sick?



<P>

- Why do you ask?

- You look sick.



<P>

- I am sick.

- You take medicine?



<P>

There is no medicine

for what I have.



<P>

- Wanna sing?

- Sing?



<P>

Do you know "He's Got

the Whole World in His Hands"?



<P>

Yes, I do.



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

He's got

the whole wide world





<P>

Come on.



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

He's got the whole wide world

in His hands



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

It's on the ground. Repeat.

The plane is on the ground.



<P>

But it won't be for long.

Where the hell are ya?



<P>

We're westbound

near the Lerner cutoff.



<P>



Where's Cindino?



<P>

That's my fuckin' plane!



<P>

Cyrus, help me.



<P>

- Looks like you missed your connection.

- We were-- We were coming to get you.



<P>

Please.



<P>

- Cy--

- --Onara.



<P>

No!



<P>

- Don't kill me.

- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.



<P>

Listen, I need a syringe.





<P>

Oh, no!

Drugs'll end you, son.



<P>

Is there a first aid kit

around here?



<P>

Well, there might be one in the

fire truck over on the boneyard.



<P>

All right, thanks. You just

stay here and don't panic.



<P>

That's easy for you to say.

You don't gotta take a piss.



<P>

- Let's get it on.

- Oh, yeah, that's nice.

- Lock and load!



<P>

Considering my audience, I'm gonna

make this very quick, very simple.



<P>

This is the boneyard.

This is the hangar.



<P>



This is our plane.



<P>

- What's that?

- That's a rock.



<P>

Okay.



<P>

The convoy will enter

the boneyard through here.



<P>

Initially, we take out the first car.

Then we take out the last...



<P>

creating a trap,

an airtight cage...



<P>

filled with lots and lots

of dead people.



<P>

Nathan, set everybody

in their position, yeah?



<P>

Bring me

those propane tanks.





<P>

Whoo, go girl.



<P>

Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.

If they give you any trouble, kill 'em.



<P>

What can I do?



<P>

Take this. Go into

the boneyard, yeah?



<P>

- Anybody gets through,

you scratch their eyes out.

- You got it.



<P>

Come on, little piggy.



<P>

Closer. Closer. Closer.



<P>

Christ.

They'll be slaughtered.



<P>



This is Larkin.

Tell your men to fall back!



<P>

Now.



<P>

Come on, you stinking

piece-of-shit car!



<P>

- What are you gonna do?

- What you doin', man?



<P>

Well, Baby-O...



<P>

it's not exactly mai tais

and Yahtzee out here, but...



<P>

Iet's do it!



<P>

Gonna see what happens

now, bitch!



<P>

Bishop.





<P>

- Get the fuck off me!

- I'm gonna bust your ass!



<P>

Leave her alone, man!



<P>

Get behind the truck!



<P>

Get behind the truck!



<P>

- When you wake up, Bishop,

I'll be Johnny 24.

- You wanna fight somebody?



<P>

Don't treat women

like that!



<P>

Aw, shit!



<P>

Whoa! Whoa!



<P>



Get back to the plane!



<P>

Oh, my god!



<P>

Okay!



<P>

You might better

get yourself Air a seat now.



<P>

- Come on.

- Oh, shit! We're in.



<P>

Just take it and let's go.

Get ready to move.



<P>

We're tied up!



<P>

- Now, come on!

- Okay, I'm comin'.



<P>

- Go for the tyres!

- Fuck the tyres!

I'm goin' for the pilot!





<P>

Isn't that your car,

Malloy?



<P>

Couldn't be.

I left mine at the office.



<P>

On any other day,

that might seem strange.



<P>

Gotta get her nose up!



<P>

Fuckers!

Come on!



<P>

- When this is over,

so are you, you little prick!

- Okay.



<P>

Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.



<P>

Go, girl!



<P>



Sweet home Alabama



<P>

All right!



<P>

Where the skies

are so blue



<P>

Define irony.



<P>

Bunch of idiots

dancing on a plane...



<P>

to a song made famous by a band

that died in a plane crash.



<P>

In Birmingham

they love the governor



<P>

We all did

what we could do



<P>

Now Watergate

does not bother me





<P>

Does you conscience bother you

Tell me true



<P>

Sweet home Alabama



<P>

Someone alerted the authorities

at Carson City.



<P>

Someone told them

about our Lerner rendezvous.



<P>

Someone even killed

poor Billy Bedlam.



<P>

Now, could this all

be coincidence? Perhaps.



<P>

Then someone went

and tied a rope to our plane.



<P>

So I ask you,

what is going on?



<P>



And I answer.

We have a traitor in our midst.



<P>

Now, how do we flush

a traitor?



<P>

I don't know,

but at the count of three...



<P>

I will find out who is

on my team and who is not.



<P>

That would be one, two--



<P>

Wait! It was me.



<P>

It was me.



<P>

Don't listen to him, man.

T-T-The insulin made him crazy.



<P>

You have been near death

the entire trip?





<P>

- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.

- No, he's, he's flipped out,

man. He's nuts.



<P>

It's pretty clever,

huh, bitch?



<P>

- No! Jesus!

- No, that's clever!



<P>

"My daddy is coming home

on July 14th.



<P>

My birthday is July 14th.



<P>

I'm gonna see my daddy

for the first time ever...



<P>

on July 14th."



<P>

Make a move,

and the bunny gets it.



<P>



- Let's take him out, Larkin.

- Not yet!



<P>

Fire!



<P>

Goddamn it, Malloy!



<P>

- Cease fire!

- Get up here!



<P>

- What are we waiting for?

- That is my plane!



<P>

You got it, Agent Malloy?

You with me?



<P>

Or do you need me to draw it

in crayon, like usual?



<P>

I got a bad feeling, son.



<P>

- I'm feeling like maybe

I'm not supposed to make it.

- You're gonna make it.





<P>

Cyrus Grissom, this is

Special Agent Vince Larkin.



<P>

We will shoot the plane down

if you do not respond now.



<P>

All I can think about is like,

there ain't no God.



<P>

That He don't exist.



<P>

- Hey, where you goin'?

- I'm gonna show you God does exist!



<P>

Fire!



<P>

Malloy, you son of a bitch!

Cease fire!



<P>

Yes!



<P>



Freeze, little bitch boy!



<P>

- Switch to missile.

- Roger that, Two.



<P>

Arming missiles.



<P>

Malloy, don't you do it!

Get in his way.



<P>

Shit!



<P>

What the hell

are you doing, Larkin?



<P>

- I got no move, sir.

- Stupid bastard!



<P>

- No! Poe!

- Land this thing!



<P>

- Where the hell is the Virus?

- I'm the new captain.

Put this thing down.





<P>

Target locked, sir.



<P>

- Oh, yeah!

- Don't you do it!



<P>

- Don't shoot!

- Don't fire.



<P>

- Who is this?

- Identify yourself Air.



<P>

- This is Cameron Poe.

- Yes!



<P>

Poe!



<P>

Poe!



<P>

- I repeat, target is locked, sir.

- Malloy, he's got the plane!



<P>



We're not over civilian population.

Now is the time, sir.



<P>

- Don't fire.

- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!



<P>

He's just trying to get home

to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!



<P>

Now's the time, sir.



<P>

- Hold fire.

- Sir?



<P>

- I said hold fire!

- Thank you.



<P>

Poe!



<P>

Poe!



<P>

- Cyrus!

- What?





<P>

All right, Poe,

the Las Vegas Airport.



<P>

It's just past the strip.

Can you see it?



<P>

Well, viva Las Vegas.



<P>

It's right there, man. You can

make it. All the runways are

cleared. Come on, do it, Poe.



<P>

Put this thing down.



<P>

Listen here, big daddy.

We got one engine shot to shit...



<P>

zero fuel,

and we're droppin' too fast.



<P>

The strip's where I'm gonna

land. Only the word is crash.



<P>



Should've shot 'em down

over the open desert, Larkin.



<P>

Now the civilian casualties

will be enormous.



<P>

Strap in, ladies. We're goin'

for a night out in Vegas.



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

He's got the whole world

in His hands



<P>

- He's got the whole wide world

in His hands

- Shut the fuck up, you freak!

We're gonna die!



<P>

- Can he make it to the airport?

- No way, sir.



<P>

All right. We're gonna need

police cars, uh, fire engines,

emergency service vehicles,



<P>

anybody who knows CPR.





<P>

Oh, this is beautiful!



<P>

Wake up, Cyrus!



<P>

In His hands



<P>

Little, bitty babies



<P>

Cyrus, wake up!



<P>

Stay with me.



<P>

Will the driver of the

white corvette please move

your car or it will be towed.



<P>

We are shit outta road!

I'm outta here!



<P>



Before I kill you, Poe,

I just wanted you to know...



<P>

that the last thing that little

Casey Poe ever gets to smell...



<P>

will be my stinking breath.



<P>

Freeze!



<P>

Okay, lady,

hold it right there!



<P>

- How am I doin', son?

- You're doin' fine.



<P>

Check you out at the hospital,

son. You're gonna be fine.



<P>

- Yeah, this one's dead.

- We better get him outta here.



<P>

So what are you

gonna do now?





<P>

I started this day with a birthday party

to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.



<P>

Thank you.



<P>

You take care,

Sally Bishop.



<P>

Hey, Poe.



<P>

Next time, take the bus.



<P>

Come on, sweetie.

Go with Ginny and your mom.



<P>

- Cyrus.

- Grissom.



<P>

Move!



<P>



Come get it!

Come on now!



<P>

- That gun work?

- Yeah.



<P>

Well, shoot

that piece of shit!



<P>

Jesus!



<P>

- What the hell is that?

- You pull over.



<P>

Yeah, sure.

How 'bout this?



<P>

You ain't gettin' near

my daughter. Buckle up.



<P>

Just so's you know,

Marshal Larkin...



<P>

there's now three men

I trust.





<P>

Am I one of 'em?



<P>

This is a weird thing to be

on a plane full of hard asses.



<P>

- You okay?

- No.



<P>

Good. I'm glad we didn't

shoot it down, huh?



<P>

Oh, yeah, worked out

much better this way.



<P>

Listen, l--



<P>

I wanna apologize

about the car.



<P>

I know a good body shop

in Fresno if it's insured.



<P>



- I was bored with that car anyway.

- It worked out nicely then.



<P>

How do I



<P>

Get through one night

without you



<P>

If I had to live

without you



<P>

What kind of life

would that be



<P>

Oh, now



<P>

I need you in my arms

Need you to hold me



<P>

- Hello, Cameron.

- You're my world, my heart, my soul



<P>

- Hello, hummingbird.

- If you ever leave





<P>

- Baby, you would take away everything

- I meant to get a haircut.



<P>

Good in my life



<P>

I got a present for ya,

Casey.



<P>

Without you



<P>

A little dirty.



<P>

Casey, sweetie, you take

your daddy's present now.



<P>

No, no, no, honey.

It's okay.



<P>

I got a picture,

a picture of you.



<P>



I got a picture

of you, too.



<P>

Baby, I don't know

what I would do



<P>

I'd be lost

if I lost you



<P>

If you ever leave



<P>

- Baby, you would take away

- Happy birthday, darlin'.



<P>

Everything real

in my life



<P>

And tell me now



<P>

How do I live

without you



<P>

I want to know





<P>

How do I breathe

without you



<P>

If you ever go



<P>

How do I ever



<P>

Ever survive



<P>

New shooter comin' out, new shooter.

Does the new shooter feel lucky?



<P>

Well, does he?



<P>

Yes, yes he does.



<P>

Big wheels keep on turnin'



<P>



Carry me home to see my kin



<P>

Singing' songs

about the Southland



<P>

I miss Alabamy once again

and I think it's a sin



<P>

Sweet home Alabama



<P>

Where the skies are so blue



<P>

Sweet home Alabama



<P>

Lord, I'm comin' home to you



<P>

Sweet home Alabama



<P>

Oh, sweet home, man





<P>

- Where the skies are so blue

- And the dark is true



<P>

Sweet home Alabama



<P>

Lordy



<P>

Lord, I'm comin' home to you



<P>

Here I come, Alabama
