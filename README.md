My final project for GOV1005 (Data): a large scale analysis of Nicolas Cage's filmography.  

My final project analyzes the movie scripts of Nicolas Cage films using sentiment analysis, and plots various aspects of Nicolas Cage’s career including box office revenue and Metacritic scores. 

Sentiment analysis shows that Nicolas Cage’s film career has yielded many films of deeply negative affect as well as relatively positive films. Plotting various aspects of Nicolas Cage’s career has shown that his PG-rated movies have yielded more revenue over time, while his PG-13 and R rated movies vary in box office success. Additionally, over time, there has been a steady decrease in Metacritic scores across each MPAA rating of movie. Finally, average sentiment for each film shows (as expected) that PG films are generally more positive when compared to PG-13 and R rated movies, although R movie average sentiment varies greatly.
