A large scale analysis of Nicolas Cage's filmography. 

American actor Nicolas Cage, star of such films as 'Moonstruck' and 'The Rock,' is known for his intense on- and off-screen personality, as well as his passion for method acting. I am personally a big fan, although many people are not due to his eccentric style and varying successes. 

My final project analyzes the movie scripts of Nicolas Cage films using sentiment analysis, and plots various aspects of Nicolas Cage’s career including [box office revenue and Metacritic scores taken from IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115). Special thanks to [Walt Hickey](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/walt-hickey/) (FiveThirtyEight) for providing me with baseline data. 

Sentiment analysis shows that Nicolas Cage’s film career has yielded many films of deeply negative affect as well as relatively positive films. Plotting various aspects of Nicolas Cage’s career has shown that his PG-rated movies have yielded more revenue over time, while his PG-13 and R rated movies vary in box office success. Additionally, over time, there has been a steady decrease in Metacritic scores across each MPAA rating of movie. Finally, average sentiment for each film shows (as expected) that PG films are generally more positive when compared to PG-13 and R rated movies, although R movie average sentiment varies greatly.
