                        1<br> With every sun comes a new day.<br> A new beginning.<br> A hope that things will be better today<br> than they were yesterday.<br> But not for me.<br> My name is Eep.<br> And this is my family, the Croods.<br> If you weren't clued in already by the<br> animal skins<br> and sloping foreheads,<br> we're cavemen.<br> Most days we spend in our cave,<br> in the dark.<br> Night after night, day after day.<br> Yep, home sweet home.<br> When we did go out, we struggled to<br> find food in a harsh and hostile world.<br> And I struggled to survive my family.<br> We were the last ones around.<br> There used to be neighbors.<br> The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.<br> The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.<br> The Erfs, mosquito bite.<br> Throgs, common cold.<br> And the Croods, that's us.<br> The Croods made it, because of my dad.<br> He was strong,<br> and he followed the rules.<br> The ones painted on the cave walls.<br> Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.<br> Going out at night is bad.<br> Basically, anything fun is bad.<br> Welcome to my world.<br> But this is a story about how<br> all that changed in an instant.<br> Because what we didn't know<br> was that our world...<br> was about to come to an end.<br> And there were no rules on our<br> cave walls to prepare us for that.<br> You are supposed to wait<br> for my signal. Eep?<br> Boo.<br> Ow! No!<br> We've been in that cave forever.<br> Three days is not forever.<br> It is with this family.<br> Eep, would you come down here?<br> You're being so dramatic.<br> No, Sandy, come back here.<br> Remember the signal.<br> Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.<br> As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,<br> and you can give the signal.<br> No, I mean, you're already out now.<br> I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.<br> Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.<br> But if you don't give the signal,<br> how do I know you're my dad?<br> The signal isn't so you know it's me.<br> It's so you know I wasn't eaten<br> by an animal.<br> Then why is the signal an animal noise?<br> Doesn't that just confuse things?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm still waiting for the signal.<br> Mom, we're ready to leave.<br> Mom?<br> Still alive.<br> It's still early.<br> And you're still fat.<br> Breakfast formation!<br> I want to see some real caveman action<br> out there. We do this fast.<br> We do this loud.<br> We do this as a family.<br> And never not be afraid!<br> Yay, breakfast.<br> Who's up?<br> We'll flip for it.<br> Call her in the air.<br> Heads!<br> Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.<br> Okay. Thunk...<br> Go.<br> Come on, Thunk.<br> Way to go.<br> Take it to the cave.<br> Release the baby!<br> Get them, Sandy! Go!<br> Get them, Mom!<br> Old lady down!<br> Eep, avenge me!<br> Thanks.<br> Eep!<br> Heads up!<br> Hey Dad, can we eat now?<br> Just wait till we get home.<br> Eep, put on the brakes.<br> Eep!<br> - Who is hungry?<br> - All right! Good one, Dad.<br> Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.<br> - Sorry, Dad.<br> - Looks like fast food tonight.<br> That's all right. I ate last week.<br> Two knuckle warning!<br> Come on, Croods. Go, go.<br> Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.<br> We know this.<br> The moon is full. Bath night.<br> - Run for your life!<br> - You too, Mom.<br> I don't want to lose<br> my protective layer.<br> Mom, you've got ants.<br> See? Sandy doesn't fuss.<br> Is she still out there?<br> You know she hates the cave, Grug.<br> Please come back tomorrow.<br> How could she not like the cave?<br> It's so cozy.<br> It is a little dark, Grug.<br> It's not that dark.<br> Eep!<br> Eep?<br> Come on, I have to close the cave.<br> Eep!<br> Okay, okay.<br> Come on.<br> Eep! Come down!<br> - That was too close.<br> - I was watching. I was fine.<br> - What were you doing up there, Eep?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What were you looking for?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Then why did you go up there?<br> - I don't know.<br> Why don't you know?<br> Stop looking for things.<br> Fear keeps us alive, Eep.<br> Never not be afraid.<br> What is the point of all this?<br> What was that?<br> Why are we here?<br> What are we doing this for?<br> No one said survival was fun.<br> Nothing is fun.<br> - Would you come down here?<br> - Grug.<br> - Eap.<br> - Grug.<br> - Yes.<br> - Off!<br> - Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...<br> - Off.<br> I just don't see why<br> she needs her own ledge, that's all.<br> - That's what this is about.<br> - She's working through some things...<br> and she needs her own space.<br> What things?<br> How long is this going to take?<br> Really?<br> She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!<br> See? She's listening.<br> If she wants to survive,<br> she has to follow our rules.<br> How about a story?<br> Eep loves those.<br> That's a good ide...<br> How about a story, huh?<br> Yeah, tell us a story.<br> Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.<br> Eep, your old favorite.<br> I haven't played with that thing in years.<br> Tonight we'll hear the story<br> of Krispy Bear.<br> A long time ago,<br> this little bear was alive.<br> She was alive<br> because she listened to her father...<br> and lived her life in routine<br> and darkness and terror.<br> So she was happy.<br> But Krispy had one terrible problem.<br> She was filled with... curiosity.<br> - Grug.<br> - Yes. yes.<br> And one day, while she was in a tree...<br> the curious little bear<br> wanted to climb to the top.<br> And no sooner than<br> she climbed to the top...<br> she saw something new and died!<br> - Just like that?<br> - Yes!<br> Her last moments of terror<br> still frozen on her face.<br> Same ending as every day.<br> I get it, Dad. I will never do<br> anything new or different.<br> Good man, Thunk.<br> All right, everyone<br> sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.<br> Air.<br> You talk.<br> I'm a person, like you.<br> Sort of like you.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Would you mind not...<br> That tickles.<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Quiet!<br> I'm not supposed to be out here.<br> Eep is gone.<br> What? Grug!<br> Stay in the cave.<br> Wow. You are really strong.<br> Hey! No! It's mine.<br> - Please! Wait.<br> - No!<br> - It's dying! I can fix it!<br> - No! I caught it!<br> Please! Please.<br> I hate the dark.<br> Come on, come on, come on.<br> It does what you tell it?<br> Yeah. Sort of.<br> The sun?<br> No, no, no. Fire.<br> Hi, fire.<br> It's not alive.<br> But you said it was dying.<br> Sorry.<br> It comes from where you come from?<br> No. No, I make it.<br> - Make some for me.<br> - Okay.<br> Make!<br> It doesn't come out of me.<br> Make! Make it!<br> You do this a lot.<br> Are you dead?<br> Can I have your fire if you're dead?<br> Clear!<br> Hey, those are cold!<br> You think? Listening shells, activate.<br> I concur.<br> Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.<br> I don't even know you.<br> I'm Guy.<br> Guy?<br> And this is Belt.<br> Cook, conversationalist, navigator.<br> Also, keeps my pants up.<br> What are "pants up"?<br> Who are you?<br> Eep.<br> Let me clarify, Eep.<br> The world is ending.<br> What?<br> I'm calling it "The End."<br> How do you know?<br> I have seen it. It's coming this way.<br> First, the ground is going to shake.<br> Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.<br> Fire. Lava.<br> I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...<br> Believe me, everything we are<br> standing on will be gone.<br> We got to get to high ground.<br> I know a mountain, that way.<br> It's our only chance.<br> Come with me.<br> I can't.<br> Okay.<br> Here.<br> If you survive, call me.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> Hey!<br> Dad!<br> Are you hurt? What took you?<br> Nothing. I left on my own.<br> You what?<br> Dad, let me explain.<br> You never let me talk.<br> You're grounded.<br> Hey!<br> Eep!<br> Mom.<br> Grug! What happened?<br> You know what, I am so mad right now<br> that I can't talk to her.<br> Eep?<br> You will never believe it.<br> I found something new.<br> New!<br> New is a big problem!<br> Wait, wait!<br> Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.<br> - It wasn't bad.<br> -"New" is always bad.<br> No. He was nice.<br> What? Excuse me? He?<br> I thought he was a warthog,<br> but then he turned into a boy.<br> Strange.<br> Usually it's the reverse.<br> Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...<br> There was a boy.<br> Watch. I'm going to call him.<br> What is wrong with you?<br> It was dangerous.<br> It was beautiful!<br> You want to see dangerous? Here!<br> My sniffer!<br> Okay, that's it!<br> We're going back to the cave...<br> and you're going to stay in there<br> until you're older than...<br> her!<br> What!<br> You can't keep me inside forever!<br> He said this would happen.<br> Get to the cave!<br> Go!<br> Look out!<br> Stop!<br> Is everyone okay?<br> Yes.<br> Grug, the cave...<br> it's gone.<br> No.<br> You really need to see this.<br> We should go there!<br> No. No one is going anywhere.<br> What else did that boy say?<br> Grug?<br> Just go! Just go!<br> Go!<br> One, two, three, four, five...<br> Six.<br> Where are we?<br> I don't know. I'm not sure.<br> Down.<br> In a lower place.<br> But one thing is for sure,<br> we can't go back the way we came.<br> Sandy? What is it?<br> No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!<br> We can't be out in the open like this.<br> We need a cave.<br> Now, step where I step.<br> Okay. Stay quiet.<br> Hopefully, nothing big<br> knows we're here yet.<br> Wait.<br> Okay.<br> Wait.<br> Okay.<br> Wait!<br> Wait.<br> Okay.<br> Wait.<br> Wait.<br> So, Dad...<br> just to be clear, are we looking for<br> the exact same cave?<br> If it was me...<br> I'm just throwing this out there...<br> if it was me choosing the cave...<br> I would go with a smaller cave.<br> Wait.<br> Dad?<br> I'll take care of this.<br> All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!<br> Now you got them right...<br> Man, they're really...<br> I'm loving this.<br> Dad, I got it.<br> Just stop running into their fists.<br> Grug, when you're done,<br> we should get going.<br> That's right. You can't get past this!<br> Climb! Climb! Climb!<br> Cave!<br> Go! Go!<br> Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.<br> Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!<br> Okay.<br> That's one, two, three, four, five, six.<br> And seven...<br> if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.<br> It's scared of the dark.<br> Wait, we're scared of the dark.<br> Kill circle!<br> Eep!<br> Eep!<br> - Cavies!<br> -"Cavies"?<br> Cavemen! Stand back!<br> They're practically animals.<br> - You see their bony, sloping foreheads?<br> - Yeah.<br> The huge primitive teeth?<br> Yeah.<br> The excessive body hair.<br> That one has got a tail.<br> Yeah.<br> All right. Close your eyes.<br> I'm going to have to take their lives.<br> No! It won't help.<br> They're my family.<br> What?<br> The sun is in his hands!<br> No, no. It's "fire."<br> Where did it come from?<br> He made it.<br> Make some for me!<br> It doesn't come out of him.<br> Make. Make it!<br> You're a lot like your daughter.<br> Great, now he's broken.<br> It's a baby sun.<br> Hey, stay back.<br> We don't know what it wants.<br> Now, we'll all sit here<br> and wait for the sun to come back.<br> And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...<br> and pretend today never happened.<br> Isn't this fun, Eep?<br> Eep, don't touch him.<br> Goodness knows where he's been.<br> Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.<br> Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.<br> What a cute little guy.<br> Hey. Stay back.<br> No, no, no, wait!<br> It likes me.<br> Hey! It's biting me!<br> Thunk! Try hiding from it<br> in the tall, dry grass!<br> No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.<br> They're biting me!<br> More fire babies.<br> Hi.<br> So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.<br> Yeah. But I won't let him.<br> Hold on, son. Come back!<br> No, stop! Let me go!<br> Get out! Out! Out!<br> Eat up, babies!<br> No, stop touching me!<br> Die!<br> I win!<br> They're not so scary<br> once you get to know them.<br> Who are you people?<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're the Croods!<br> And you are?<br> Guy.<br> Hi, Guy.<br> Wow!<br> It looks like magic.<br> And smells like food.<br> No, don't eat it, it's new.<br> Still alive!<br> Come on, keep eating.<br> Hey, where is Guy?<br> No!<br> Going somewhere?<br> The mountain? High ground?<br> End of the world, remember?<br> That already happened.<br> It destroyed our cave.<br> No. That was just the beginning of the end.<br> The end of the end is still coming.<br> Eep. Drop it.<br> We can't let him go!<br> What if we don't find a<br> cave before sunset?<br> What if it takes a few days?<br> What if the birds come back?<br> We need his fire, dummy!<br> Fine. You're staying with us<br> until we find a cave.<br> What? No, I'm not.<br> Don't make me a part of this!<br> Stay here if you want, but let me go.<br> I've got a dream...<br> a mission, a reason to live!<br> Not anymore.<br> I've got an idea.<br> Let's go to that mountain.<br> It's too far.<br> Dad really has his heart set on a cave.<br> There are caves on that mountain.<br> Have you been there?<br> It's a mountain.<br> Mountains are safe.<br> Mountains have caves.<br> And water. And sticks.<br> Mom? Did you hear that?<br> I can get my own stick!<br> Yes. Sticks and caves.<br> Caves and sticks.<br> Crazy sticks. Let's go.<br> Quiet!<br> That thing is weird.<br> No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.<br> That's just Belt.<br> I've made a decision.<br> We're going to that mountain.<br> Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.<br> Just feels right.<br> I don't know, Grug.<br> We've never really walked that far.<br> I don't think my feet can do that.<br> I'll never live long enough to get there.<br> Let's do it.<br> Come on, just think.<br> Our whole family packed together<br> on a long, slow, trip across country?<br> Days and nights with just each other.<br> We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.<br> We'll become closer as a family.<br> Get her off!<br> If you're not ready to challenge her,<br> then don't look her in the eye.<br> Could you keep your big giant arms<br> on your side of the trail?<br> Isn't this fun?<br> We're taking our first trip together.<br> Stop shoving,<br> or I will pull out your tongue!<br> Do you want me to<br> turn this family around? Do you?<br> Because I will<br> turn this family around so fast!<br> Dad, I gotta go!<br> - Come on, you can hold it.<br> - I don't think so.<br> Sandy, take that out of your mouth.<br> - I'm touching...<br> - Gran.<br> Dad, I still gotta go!<br> Fine. Just go behind one of those<br> lumpy things and make it fast.<br> - Something bit me!<br> - I don't blame it.<br> Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?<br> No.<br> - How about now?<br> - No.<br> - Now?<br> - No.<br> Now?<br> I can do this all day long.<br> No, no, no and still no.<br> I'm not dying on an empty stomach.<br> Grug, we're all pretty tired!<br> We'll eat when we get there.<br> It's taking too long!<br> I'm grabbing a snack.<br> Don't do that. He will cut you.<br> That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.<br> What's a pet?<br> An animal you don't eat.<br> We call those "children."<br> No man should have a pet.<br> It's weird and wrong.<br> - It's food!<br> - No, please!<br> Not that. That!<br> Food fixes everything.<br> Show me your hunting face.<br> Not you. You're still grounded.<br> Come on, Thunk.<br> My feet hurt.<br> - You look tense.<br> - I'm not tense.<br> Angry girl wants to be doing<br> what they're doing.<br> I wasn't ready.<br> Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!<br> Why are you doing this?<br> What are they doing?<br> Hunting.<br> Get it off! You stay away from me.<br> No, seriously, what are they doing?<br> You've got a ton of eggs.<br> Just make another egg.<br> Now you're just rubbing it in.<br> There, who's hungry for scorpion?<br> What happened to the egg and the bird?<br> We lost him.<br> But when the bird stepped on me<br> and pushed me into the ground...<br> the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...<br> and one thing led to another<br> and here we are eating him.<br> So, win-win.<br> Not enough. Not enough!<br> I need more.<br> I need more.<br> Look at that.<br> She's not going to eat me, right?<br> You're too skinny.<br> If she was going to eat anyone<br> it would be...<br> Mom!<br> She's locked her jaw!<br> Get a stick! Get a stick!<br> Stay away!<br> You sick old monster!<br> Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!<br> Hold her still. Use a rock.<br> Ugga, would you just hit her legs?<br> Why are you rolling away?<br> I just want something to eat.<br> You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!<br> Please.<br> I'll let you help me hunt.<br> Really?<br> Don't wait on me. They're all over me.<br> Tell my story.<br> Okay.<br> What do you call this?<br> A trap.<br> What does it do?<br> Well...<br> How long have you been alone?<br> So, what do we do?<br> How's your acting?<br> You're good at this.<br> No. Sorry.<br> Okay.<br> - Yeah, that's yours.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Your other hand...<br> - That's my arm.<br> - Okay, I'm moving it.<br> Going under.<br> It didn't step in your trap-y thing.<br> Yeah, I noticed!<br> Where's Eep?<br> She's awesome.<br> Eep!<br> Dad,no!<br> It's an avalanche of flavor.<br> Looks like we won't be<br> having any leftovers.<br> What are "left overs"?<br> When you have so much food to eat,<br> you have some left over.<br> We never have that much food.<br> Grug, how about a story?<br> That's a good idea. How about a story?<br> Yeah, tell us a story!<br> Once upon a time,<br> there was a little tiger...<br> who lived in a cave with her family.<br> There were a lot of rules...<br> but the big, simple one<br> was to never leave the cave at night.<br> And the door was so heavy,<br> you'd think it would be easy to remember.<br> So easy to remember!<br> I know.<br> But, while everyone was asleep...<br> she went out anyway.<br> - No!<br> - Yes!<br> And no sooner than she did,<br> their cave was destroyed...<br> and everyone had to go<br> on this long, sucky walk...<br> with some weirdo they met...<br> and die!<br> The end.<br> I did not see that coming. Twist ending.<br> My stories never end like that.<br> Yes! Two stories in one night!<br> Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.<br> Once upon a time,<br> there was a beautiful tiger.<br> She lived in a cave<br> with the rest of her family.<br> Her father and mother told her,<br> "You may go anywhere you want..."<br> "but never go near the cliff,<br> for you could fall."<br> And die. Good story.<br> But when no one was looking...<br> she'd go near the cliff...<br> for the closer she came to the edge...<br> the more she could hear,<br> the more she could see...<br> the more she could feel.<br> Finally...<br> she stood at the very edge.<br> She saw a light.<br> She leaned out to touch it...<br> and she slipped.<br> And she fell.<br> And she flew.<br> Where did she fly?<br> Tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow?<br> A place with more suns in the sky<br> than you can count.<br> It would be so bright.<br> A place not like today, or yesterday.<br> A place where things are better.<br> Tomorrow isn't a place.<br> You can't see it!<br> Yes, it is.<br> I've seen it.<br> That's where I'm going.<br> We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.<br> And when we wake up...<br> we're going to find the place<br> that has everything we want.<br> Tomorrow?<br> A cave.<br> That was too close. it almost caught us.<br> I was watching. We were fine.<br> We gotta move faster.<br> Do you people have any other speed<br> aside from "wander"?<br> I'll take a shamble at this point.<br> Hey, do you have a minute?<br> How did the tiger fly?<br> I only share when I'm outside the log.<br> I'm funny that way.<br> Leave this to me.<br> Hey, Thunk...<br> you have a spider on your face.<br> Oops.<br> He's loose!<br> Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.<br> Do you mean these rocks?<br> Do not step on these rocks!<br> Step aside, girls.<br> Hello? Nobody's listening!<br> No one is listening.<br> You cannot walk on those!<br> Get back here now!<br> There goes our chance for survival.<br> And our log!<br> Okay.<br> Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...<br> but it doesn't get better.<br> How about...<br> Don't walk on your hands.<br> The hands do not help at all.<br> Come on.<br> I can help you...<br> but we're going to have to<br> make a few changes around here.<br> The log ride is over.<br> Drop the log.<br> Now, kick it away.<br> Farther.<br> Really?<br> Okay, smart "Guy"...<br> now what?<br> Good fish, good fish.<br> Okay. Now you can look.<br> I love them!<br> Where are my feet?<br> They're still there!<br> Okay.<br> You're really heavy.<br> Really?<br> Thank you!<br> Hey. Wait!<br> Okay.<br> She's up. We're good. I'm good.<br> These shoes are great!<br> Where do you get these ideas?<br> I'm calling it a "brain."<br> I'm pretty sure it's<br> where ideas come from.<br> Dad, I don't have a brain.<br> We've gotten along just fine<br> without brains until now.<br> Cavemen don't need brains.<br> We have these.<br> That's what I'm talking about!<br> Ideas are for weaklings.<br> Now, let's get to that mountain!<br> Wow! I love those!<br> Good fish. Don't eat my feet.<br> So, how did the tiger fly?<br> She jumped on the sun...<br> and rode it to Tomorrow.<br> No,no,no.<br> Hi, Dad!<br> Bye. Dad!<br> You've seen rain before, right?<br> We don't get out much.<br> Eep, looks dangerous.<br> Dad, you say that about everything.<br> Careful.<br> Really? Okay.<br> No, no, no. Not cool!<br> So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been<br> dumping my bones here since last week."<br> Last week!<br> That's a funny story!<br> It's not a story. It's a joke.<br> What's a "joke"?<br> Just making something up<br> to make you laugh.<br> - One for you.<br> - Thanks.<br> One for you. And this one's for you.<br> Okay.<br> Okay! That's enough!<br> I don't see why the kids<br> need their own shells.<br> So if anyone gets in trouble,<br> we can call the others.<br> Wait, you're saying we should split up?<br> We can try more paths at once.<br> It's the fastest way through.<br> Croods stick together.<br> Your way isn't safe.<br> They can handle it.<br> We can do it, Dad.<br> No,no,no.<br> It's my job to keep you safe.<br> I'm still in charge<br> and we are not splitting up.<br> Except for you two.<br> And that's final.<br> Hello?<br> Is everyone all right?<br> We're okay, Grug.<br> Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.<br> Just tell me what to do.<br> What do I do? What do I do right now?<br> Stay where you are. I'll find you.<br> No. Too slow.<br> Everybody, keep moving forward<br> and we'll get out.<br> Dad?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Remember, never not be afraid.<br> You can do this!<br> It's going to be okay,<br> it's going to be okay.<br> I'm going to pass out.<br> Sandy. Sandy!<br> Give me another one.<br> You dropped these.<br> Come with me.<br> Here, boy! Catch!<br> Yoo-hoo!<br> Gran?<br> Mom?<br> Wow.<br> Grug?<br> I'll go get him.<br> Good boy! Who's a good boy?<br> You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!<br> You need a name. You want a name?<br> I'm going to call you Douglas.<br> Can you do tricks? Roll over.<br> Come on, Douglas, roll over.<br> Good boy, Douglas!<br> I was in love once.<br> He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.<br> It was quite a scandal.<br> We fed each other berries, we danced.<br> Then my father smashed him with a rock<br> and traded me to your grandfather.<br> Croods!<br> Get down here.<br> Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.<br> Guy is with them. Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you for bringing me<br> that interesting Guy update.<br> Okay. I'm going to go up...<br> and why don't you join us<br> when you stop being a big drag!<br> Sleep pile?<br> How about a story?<br> Anyone?<br> And then Torg said,<br> "Know it? I drew it."<br> That makes no sense.<br> I know it was hard for you<br> to bring us along...<br> but they had the<br> best day of their lives.<br> Thank you for that.<br> I want to show you something.<br> More suns in the sky than you can count.<br> Every sun that crosses our sky<br> comes to rest up there.<br> Tomorrow.<br> That's where we'll be safe.<br> I'm going with Guy.<br> No. Not my little girl.<br> Come with us.<br> I can't go without Grug.<br> That makes one of us. Count me in.<br> Really, Mom? Now?<br> Grug has no idea how to protect us.<br> In fact, he has no ideas at all!<br> No, that's not true.<br> What about that one time when he...<br> Face it.<br> If he actually had an idea of his own...<br> I'd have a heart attack and die!<br> Grug?<br> - Dad!<br> - Dad!<br> He's a big guy. How could he<br> just disappear like that?<br> Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady<br> if she's seen Dad.<br> Haven't seen him.<br> What are you doing?<br> Yeah.<br> I was up all night, because<br> all these ideas just kept coming to me.<br> Is that a snake?<br> Belt, new and improved.<br> It's even self-tightening!<br> What is that on your head?<br> It's called desperation.<br> I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."<br> And this one, I call it a "ride."<br> Rhymes with "Grug."<br> That doesn't rhyme...<br> It's going to get us<br> places faster than shoes.<br> Yeah! Try to keep up!<br> I wish I had a ride.<br> And painting is a thing of the past.<br> I call this a "snapshot."<br> Let's do it again. I think I blinked.<br> I call them "shades."<br> The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.<br> Where do you get these great ideas?<br> Since I don't have a brain...<br> they're coming from my stomach,<br> down deep below...<br> and then up again into my mind.<br> Grug, we have to keep moving.<br> See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.<br> Like this. I call it a "mobile home."<br> Isn't that something?<br> And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."<br> Mom?<br> I know. It's bad.<br> I almost feel sorry for him.<br> No, I don't.<br> What are you trying to do, Grug?<br> See, I thought if I could have ideas...<br> like Guy...<br> maybe Eep would listen to me.<br> And maybe she wouldn't<br> want to go with Guy.<br> Grug.<br> Is that what this is all about?<br> And I also thought<br> it would kill your mother.<br> So win-win.<br> We're here!<br> Wow.<br> Cave!<br> Everyone inside.<br> Hurry up. Let's go.<br> Let's go. Go!<br> No!<br> No more caves, Grug.<br> What?<br> We're going to jump on the sun<br> and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!<br> Wait. So you're all going to do this?<br> Thunk?<br> Sorry, Dad.<br> You have to stop worrying for all of us.<br> It's my job to worry!<br> It's my job to follow the rules!<br> The rules don't work out here!<br> They kept us alive!<br> That wasn't living!<br> That was just not dying.<br> There's a difference.<br> Ugga, everyone,<br> you have to listen to me.<br> We would be dead if we listened to you!<br> We have to follow Guy now.<br> Guy.<br> Guy? Run.<br> This is pointless!<br> We're running out of time.<br> Everything is collapsing.<br> You're being irrational<br> and counterproductive!<br> Big words anger me!<br> Keep talking.<br> Countermeasures!<br> You remember how you were<br> this morning? You changed.<br> Idea man. Modern man.<br> I am a caveman!<br> No, no, no, wait!<br> No!<br> What is this stuff that saves you<br> from my punches?<br> Tar.<br> No. I have to get back to them.<br> Stop struggling.<br> No!<br> Grug, stop!<br> No one gets out of this.<br> Believe me...<br> I know.<br> Your...<br> Family. Yeah.<br> Sorry.<br> I was little when it happened.<br> Last thing my parents told me was...<br> "Don't hide."<br> "Live."<br> "Follow the sun."<br> "You'll make it to Tomorrow."<br> You followed the light.<br> My daughter is a lot like you.<br> No.<br> She's like you.<br> She loves you,<br> but always forgets to say it.<br> Just like you forget to tell her.<br> I guess I was just busy<br> keeping them all alive.<br> It's okay. That's what dads do.<br> That's right.<br> But we can't do that from here.<br> We need one of your ideas.<br> Come on. You can do it.<br> Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!<br> I've got it.<br> Wow.<br> Yeah, I know. But he's doing<br> the best with what he has.<br> Let's go.<br> There he is.<br> Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.<br> Move me.<br> Okay, he sees us.<br> That's our cue. Now, work it!<br> He's not coming over.<br> I don't think our puppet<br> looks scared enough.<br> Scared? I'll show you scared.<br> Hand me those acting sticks!<br> Hold on!<br> Yes! You did it.<br> - Grug!<br> - Dad!<br> Hey! We're okay!<br> Yeah.<br> We're okay.<br> Grug, your call.<br> Take us to Tomorrow.<br> Hurry!<br> Come on! We're going to make it!<br> You were right.<br> There it is! The sun!<br> We can do it!<br> We can ride it to Tomorrow!<br> Run!<br> I don't understand.<br> The sun was right here.<br> It was right here.<br> We have to go back to the cave.<br> Hurry, hurry, hurry.<br> Stay together. Let's keep moving.<br> Move, move, move.<br> Everybody, hold my hand.<br> Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.<br> Let's stay together.<br> Grug. What's wrong with you?<br> Grug, we'll die if we stay here!<br> Grug, listen to me.<br> We've got to get back to that cave.<br> No more dark.<br> No more hiding.<br> No more caves.<br> What's the point of all this?<br> To follow the light.<br> I can't change.<br> I don't have ideas.<br> But I have my strength.<br> And right now...<br> that's all you need.<br> No, we don't know what's over there.<br> Maybe nothing!<br> It's too risky!<br> It's a chance.<br> I'll take that chance.<br> I've wanted to throw you away<br> ever since I met you.<br> That's a joke, right?<br> What's a "joke"?<br> He made it!<br> He made it.<br> Okay, Thunk. Your turn.<br> You're not coming, are you?<br> When you make it, so will I.<br> No!<br> You did good.<br> Dadda!<br> Gran...<br> No mush. Just throw me.<br> Wait.<br> You surprised me today...<br> lunkhead.<br> Still alive!<br> Time to go.<br> No.<br> I have too much to say to you.<br> I need to fix everything,<br> and I don't have time.<br> I can fix it.<br> This works good.<br> What do you call it?<br> I was thinking of calling it a "hug."<br> Because it rhymes with "Grug."<br> But you can change it if you want.<br> No. I like "hug."<br> I love you.<br> I...<br> Dad...<br> I'm scared.<br> Never be afraid.<br> There!<br> I see him!<br> Hey!<br> Hey, I did it!<br> Back! Stay back!<br> Stay back!<br> They're in trouble.<br> Hang on, I'm coming!<br> How do I get across?<br> I have to think. What would Guy do?<br> What would Guy do, what would Guy do?<br> What would I do?<br> Hold this.<br> I have...<br> an idea!<br> Run!<br> Yes!<br> Douglas?<br> Hey, I know that guy.<br> Hold on!<br> It's not safe here.<br> I'll tell her.<br> I never got to tell him.<br> Eep, if your dad were here,<br> he would tell you to...<br> Get out of the way!<br> Wow. You sound just like him.<br> Get out of the way!<br> Dadda!<br> He did it!<br> He's riding the sun.<br> But, not very well.<br> Everybody out of the way!<br> - Dad!<br> - Grug!<br> Where's the danger?<br> Who blew their shell?<br> I love you, too!<br> One, two, three, four...<br> five...<br> six...<br> and seven.<br> And a half.<br> And eight.<br> Nine.<br> Douglas! Dad, you saved him!<br> A boy has to have a pet.<br> Turns out I'm a cat person.<br> No.<br> You really need to see this.<br> We should go there.<br> Yes! Coming through!<br> Wait!<br> This is me. My name is Eep.<br> And this is my family, the Croods.<br> If you weren't clued in<br> by the suntans and pets...<br> we're not exactly cavemen anymore.<br> Let's do it again. I think I blinked.<br> Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...<br> but now we know the Croods will make it.<br> Because we changed the rules...<br> the ones that kept us in the dark.<br> And because of my dad,<br> who taught us that anyone can change.<br> Release the baby!<br> Sort of.<br> So, from now on,<br> we'll stay out here...<br> where we can follow the light.<br>
